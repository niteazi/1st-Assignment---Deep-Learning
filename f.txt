the warning i am inclined to think said i i should do so sherlock holmes remarked impatiently i believe that i am one of the most longsuffering of mortals but ill admit that i was annoyed at the sardonic interruption really holmes said i severely you are a little trying at times he was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance he leaned upon his hand with his untasted breakfast before him and he stared at the slip of paper which he had just drawn from its envelope then he took the envelope itself held it up to the light and very carefully studied both the exterior and the flap it is porlocks writing said he thoughtfully i can hardly doubt that it is porlocks writing though i have seen it only twice before the greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive but if it is porlock then it must be something of the very first importance he was speaking to himself rather than to me but my vexation disappeared in the interest which the words awakened who then is porlock i asked porlock watson is a nomdeplume a mere identification mark but behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality in a former letter he frankly informed me that the name was not his own and defied me ever to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city porlock is important not for himself but for the great man with whom he is in touch picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark the jackal with the lionanything that is insignificant in companionship with what is formidable not only formidable watson but sinisterin the highest degree sinister that is where he comes within my purview you have heard me speak of professor moriarty the famous scientific criminal as famous among crooks as my blushes watson holmes murmured in a deprecating voice i was about to say as he is unknown to the public a touch a distinct touch cried holmes you are developing a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour watson against which i must learn to guard myself but in calling moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the lawand there lie the glory and the wonder of it the greatest schemer of all time the organizer of every deviltry the controlling brain of the underworld a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nationsthats the man but so aloof is he from general suspicion so immune from criticism so admirable in his management and selfeffacement that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your years pension as a solatium for his wounded character is he not the celebrated author of the dynamics of an asteroid a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it is this a man to traduce foulmouthed doctor and slandered professorsuch would be your respective roles thats genius watson but if i am spared by lesser men our day will surely come may i be there to see i exclaimed devoutly but you were speaking of this man porlock ah yesthe socalled porlock is a link in the chain some little way from its great attachment porlock is not quite a sound linkbetween ourselves he is the only flaw in that chain so far as i have been able to test it but no chain is stronger than its weakest link exactly my dear watson hence the extreme importance of porlock led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right and encouraged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional tenpound note sent to him by devious methods he has once or twice given me advance information which has been of valuethat highest value which anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime i can not doubt that if we had the cipher we should find that this communication is of the nature that i indicate again holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate i rose and leaning over him stared down at the curious inscription which ran as follows 534 c2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41 douglas 109 293 5 37 birlstone 26 birlstone 9 47 171 what do you make of it holmes it is obviously an attempt to convey secret information but what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher in this instance none at all why do you say in this instance because there are many ciphers which i would read as easily as i do the apocrypha of the agony column such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatiguing it but this is different it is clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book until i am told which page and which book i am powerless but why douglas and birlstone clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question then why has he not indicated the book your native shrewdness my dear watson that innate cunning which is the delight of your friends would surely prevent you from inclosing cipher and message in the same envelope should it miscarry you are undone as it is both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it our second post is now overdue and i shall be surprised if it does not bring us either a further letter of explanation or as is more probable the very volume to which these figures refer holmess calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the appearance of billy the page with the very letter which we were expecting the same writing remarked holmes as he opened the envelope and actually signed he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the epistle come we are getting on watson his brow clouded however as he glanced over the contents dear me this is very disappointing i fear watson that all our expectations come to nothing i trust that the man porlock will come to no harm dear mr holmes he says i will go no further in this matter it is too dangeroushe suspects me i can see that he suspects me he came to me quite unexpectedly after i had actually addressed this envelope with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher i was able to cover it up if he had seen it it would have gone hard with me but i read suspicion in his eyes please burn the cipher message which can now be of no use to you fred porlock holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his fingers and frowning as he stared into the fire after all he said at last there may be nothing in it it may be only his guilty conscience knowing himself to be a traitor he may have read the accusation in the others eyes the other being i presume professor moriarty no less when any of that party talk about he you know whom they mean there is one predominant he for all of them but what can he do hum thats a large question when you have one of the first brains of europe up against you and all the powers of darkness at his back there are infinite possibilities anyhow friend porlock is evidently scared out of his senseskindly compare the writing in the note to that upon its envelope which was done he tells us before this illomened visit the one is clear and firm the other hardly legible why did he write at all why did he not simply drop it because he feared i would make some inquiry after him in that case and possibly bring trouble on him no doubt said i of course i had picked up the original cipher message and was bending my brows over it its pretty maddening to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it sherlock holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations i wonder said he leaning back and staring at the ceiling perhaps there are points which have escaped your machiavellian intellect let us consider the problem in the light of pure reason this mans reference is to a book that is our point of departure a somewhat vague one let us see then if we can narrow it down as i focus my mind upon it it seems rather less impenetrable what indications have we as to this book none well well it is surely not quite so bad as that the cipher message begins with a large 534 does it not we may take it as a working hypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers so our book has already become a large book which is surely something gained what other indications have we as to the nature of this large book the next sign is c2 what do you make of that watson chapter the second no doubt hardly that watson you will i am sure agree with me that if the page be given the number of the chapter is immaterial also that if page 534 finds us only in the second chapter the length of the first one must have been really intolerable column i cried brilliant watson you are scintillating this morning if it is not column then i am very much deceived so now you see we begin to visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a considerable length since one of the words is numbered in the document as the two hundred and ninetythird have we reached the limits of what reason can supply i fear that we have surely you do yourself an injustice one more coruscation my dear watsonyet another brainwave had the volume been an unusual one he would have sent it to me instead of that he had intended before his plans were nipped to send me the clue in this envelope he says so in his note this would seem to indicate that the book is one which he thought i would have no difficulty in finding for myself he had itand he imagined that i would have it too in short watson it is a very common book what you say certainly sounds plausible so we have contracted our field of search to a large book printed in double columns and in common use the bible i cried triumphantly good watson good but not if i may say so quite good enough even if i accepted the compliment for myself i could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of moriartys associates besides the editions of holy writ are so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination this is clearly a book which is standardized he knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534 but very few books would correspond with that exactly therein lies our salvation our search is narrowed down to standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess bradshaw there are difficulties watson the vocabulary of bradshaw is nervous and terse but limited the selection of words would hardly lend itself to the sending of general messages we will eliminate bradshaw the dictionary is i fear inadmissible for the same reason what then is left an almanac excellent watson i am very much mistaken if you have not touched the spot an almanac let us consider the claims of whitakers almanac it is in common use it has the requisite number of pages it is in double column though reserved in its earlier vocabulary it becomes if i remember right quite garrulous towards the end he picked the volume from his desk here is page 534 column two a substantial block of print dealing i perceive with the trade and resources of british india jot down the words watson number thirteen is mahratta not i fear a very auspicious beginning number one hundred and twentyseven is government which at least makes sense though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and professor moriarty now let us try again what does the mahratta government do alas the next word is pigsbristles we are undone my good watson it is finished he had spoken in jesting vein but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation i sat helpless and unhappy staring into the fire a long silence was broken by a sudden exclamation from holmes who dashed at a cupboard from which he emerged with a second yellowcovered volume in his hand we pay the price watson for being too uptodate he cried we are before our time and suffer the usual penalties being the seventh of january we have very properly laid in the new almanac it is more than likely that porlock took his message from the old one no doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been written now let us see what page 534 has in store for us number thirteen is there which is much more promising number one hundred and twentyseven is isthere isholmess eyes were gleaming with excitement and his thin nervous fingers twitched as he counted the wordsdanger ha ha capital put that down watson there is danger may come very soon one then we have the name douglas rich country now at birlstone house birlstone confidence is pressing there watson what do you think of pure reason and its fruit if the greengrocer had such a thing as a laurel wreath i should send billy round for it i was staring at the strange message which i had scrawled as he deciphered it upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee what a queer scrambling way of expressing his meaning said i on the contrary he has done quite remarkably well said holmes when you search a single column for words with which to express your meaning you can hardly expect to get everything you want you are bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent the purport is perfectly clear some deviltry is intended against one douglas whoever he may be residing as stated a rich country gentleman he is sureconfidence was as near as he could get to confidentthat it is pressing there is our resultand a very workmanlike little bit of analysis it was holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he aspired he was still chuckling over his success when billy swung open the door and inspector macdonald of scotland yard was ushered into the room those were the early days at the end of the 80s when alec macdonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has now achieved he was a young but trusted member of the detective force who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been entrusted to him his tall bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical strength while his great cranium and deepset lustrous eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind his bushy eyebrows he was a silent precise man with a dour nature and a hard aberdonian accent twice already in his career had holmes helped him to attain success his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem for this reason the affection and respect of the scotchman for his amateur colleague were profound and he showed them by the frankness with which he consulted holmes in every difficulty mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself but talent instantly recognizes genius and macdonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one who already stood alone in europe both in his gifts and in his experience holmes was not prone to friendship but he was tolerant of the big scotchman and smiled at the sight of him you are an early bird mr mac said he i wish you luck with your worm i fear this means that there is some mischief afoot if you said hope instead of fear it would be nearer the truth im thinking mr holmes the inspector answered with a knowing grin well maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill no i wont smoke i thank you ill have to be pushing on my way for the early hours of a case are the precious ones as no man knows better than your own self butbut the inspector had stopped suddenly and was staring with a look of absolute amazement at a paper upon the table it was the sheet upon which i had scrawled the enigmatic message douglas he stammered birlstone whats this mr holmes man its witchcraft where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names it is a cipher that dr watson and i have had occasion to solve but whywhats amiss with the names the inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed astonishment just this said he that mr douglas of birlstone manor house was horribly murdered last night
