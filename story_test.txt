it may have been a comedy or it may have been a tragedy it cost one man his reason it cost me a bloodletting and it cost yet another man the penalties of the law yet there was certainly an element of comedy well you shall judge for yourselves i remember the date very well for it was in the same month that holmes refused a knighthood for services which may perhaps some day be described i only refer to the matter in passing for in my position of partner and confidant i am obliged to be particularly careful to avoid any indiscretion i repeat however that this enables me to fix the date which was the latter end of june 1902 shortly after the conclusion of the south african war holmes had spent several days in bed as was his habit from time to time but he emerged that morning with a long foolscap document in his hand and a twinkle of amusement in his austere gray eyes there is a chance for you to make some money friend watson said he have you ever heard the name of garrideb i admitted that i had not well if you can lay your hand upon a garrideb theres money in it why ah thats a long storyrather a whimsical one too i dont think in all our explorations of human complexities we have ever come upon anything more singular the fellow will be here presently for crossexamination so i wont open the matter up till he comes but meanwhile thats the name we want the telephone directory lay on the table beside me and i turned over the pages in a rather hopeless quest but to my amazement there was this strange name in its due place i gave a cry of triumph here you are holmes here it is holmes took the book from my hand garrideb n he read 136 little ryder street w sorry to disappoint you my dear watson but this is the man himself that is the address upon his letter we want another to match him mrs hudson had come in with a card upon a tray i took it up and glanced at it why here it is i cried in amazement this is a different initial john garrideb counsellor at law moorville kansas u s a holmes smiled as he looked at the card i am afraid you must make yet another effort watson said he this gentleman is also in the plot already though i certainly did not expect to see him this morning however he is in a position to tell us a good deal which i want to know a moment later he was in the room mr john garrideb counsellor at law was a short powerful man with the round fresh cleanshaven face characteristic of so many american men of affairs the general effect was chubby and rather childlike so that one received the impression of quite a young man with a broad set smile upon his face his eyes however were arresting seldom in any human head have i seen a pair which bespoke a more intense inward life so bright were they so alert so responsive to every change of thought his accent was american but was not accompanied by any eccentricity of speech mr holmes he asked glancing from one to the other ah yes your pictures are not unlike you sir if i may say so i believe you have had a letter from my namesake mr nathan garrideb have you not pray sit down said sherlock holmes we shall i fancy have a good deal to discuss he took up his sheets of foolscap you are of course the mr john garrideb mentioned in this document but surely you have been in england some time why do you say that mr holmes i seemed to read sudden suspicion in those expressive eyes your whole outfit is english mr garrideb forced a laugh ive read of your tricks mr holmes but i never thought i would be the subject of them where do you read that the shoulder cut of your coat the toes of your bootscould anyone doubt it well well i had no idea i was so obvious a britisher but business brought me over here some time ago and so as you say my outfit is nearly all london however i guess your time is of value and we did not meet to talk about the cut of my socks what about getting down to that paper you hold in your hand holmes had in some way ruffled our visitor whose chubby face had assumed a far less amiable expression patience patience mr garrideb said my friend in a soothing voice dr watson would tell you that these little digressions of mine sometimes prove in the end to have some bearing on the matter but why did mr nathan garrideb not come with you why did he ever drag you into it at all asked our visitor with a sudden outflame of anger what in thunder had you to do with it here was a bit of professional business between two gentlemen and one of them must needs call in a detective i saw him this morning and he told me this fooltrick he had played me and thats why i am here but i feel bad about it all the same there was no reflection upon you mr garrideb it was simply zeal upon his part to gain your endan end which is i understand equally vital for both of you he knew that i had means of getting information and therefore it was very natural that he should apply to me our visitors angry face gradually cleared well that puts it different said he when i went to see him this morning and he told me he had sent to a detective i just asked for your address and came right away i dont want police butting into a private matter but if you are content just to help us find the man there can be no harm in that well that is just how it stands said holmes and now sir since you are here we had best have a clear account from your own lips my friend here knows nothing of the details mr garrideb surveyed me with not too friendly a gaze need he know he asked we usually work together well theres no reason it should be kept a secret ill give you the facts as short as i can make them if you came from kansas i would not need to explain to you who alexander hamilton garrideb was he made his money in real estate and afterwards in the wheat pit at chicago but he spent it in buying up as much land as would make one of your counties lying along the arkansas river west of fort dodge its grazingland and lumberland and arableland and mineralizedland and just every sort of land that brings dollars to the man that owns it he had no kith nor kinor if he had i never heard of it but he took a kind of pride in the queerness of his name that was what brought us together i was in the law at topeka and one day i had a visit from the old man and he was tickled to death to meet another man with his own name it was his pet fad and he was dead set to find out if there were any more garridebs in the world find me another said he i told him i was a busy man and could not spend my life hiking round the world in search of garridebs none the less said he that is just what you will do if things pan out as i planned them i thought he was joking but there was a powerful lot of meaning in the words as i was soon to discover for he died within a year of saying them and he left a will behind him it was the queerest will that has ever been filed in the state of kansas his property was divided into three parts and i was to have one on condition that i found two garridebs who would share the remainder its five million dollars for each if it is a cent but we cant lay a finger on it until we all three stand in a row it was so big a chance that i just let my legal practice slide and i set forth looking for garridebs there is not one in the united states i went through it sir with a finetoothed comb and never a garrideb could i catch then i tried the old country sure enough there was the name in the london telephone directory i went after him two days ago and explained the whole matter to him but he is a lone man like myself with some women relations but no men it says three adult men in the will so you see we still have a vacancy and if you can help to fill it we will be very ready to pay your charges well watson said holmes with a smile i said it was rather whimsical did i not i should have thought sir that your obvious way was to advertise in the agony columns of the papers i have done that mr holmes no replies dear me well it is certainly a most curious little problem i may take a glance at it in my leisure by the way it is curious that you should have come from topeka i used to have a correspondenthe is dead nowold dr lysander starr who was mayor in 1890 good old dr starr said our visitor his name is still honoured well mr holmes i suppose all we can do is to report to you and let you know how we progress i reckon you will hear within a day or two with this assurance our american bowed and departed holmes had lit his pipe and he sat for some time with a curious smile upon his face well i asked at last i am wondering watsonjust wondering at what holmes took his pipe from his lips i was wondering watson what on earth could be the object of this man in telling us such a rigmarole of lies i nearly asked him sofor there are times when a brutal frontal attack is the best policybut i judged it better to let him think he had fooled us here is a man with an english coat frayed at the elbow and trousers bagged at the knee with a years wear and yet by this document and by his own account he is a provincial american lately landed in london there have been no advertisements in the agony columns you know that i miss nothing there they are my favourite covert for putting up a bird and i would never have overlooked such a cock pheasant as that i never knew a dr lysander starr of topeka touch him where you would he was false i think the fellow is really an american but he has worn his accent smooth with years of london what is his game then and what motive lies behind this preposterous search for garridebs its worth our attention for granting that the man is a rascal he is certainly a complex and ingenious one we must now find out if our other correspondent is a fraud also just ring him up watson i did so and heard a thin quavering voice at the other end of the line yes yes i am mr nathan garrideb is mr holmes there i should very much like to have a word with mr holmes my friend took the instrument and i heard the usual syncopated dialogue yes he has been here i understand that you dont know him how long only two days yes yes of course it is a most captivating prospect will you be at home this evening i suppose your namesake will not be there very good we will come then for i would rather have a chat without him dr watson will come with me i understand from your note that you did not go out often well we shall be round about six you need not mention it to the american lawyer very good goodbye it was twilight of a lovely spring evening and even little ryder street one of the smaller offshoots from the edgware road within a stonecast of old tyburn tree of evil memory looked golden and wonderful in the slanting rays of the setting sun the particular house to which we were directed was a large oldfashioned early georgian edifice with a flat brick face broken only by two deep bay windows on the ground floor it was on this ground floor that our client lived and indeed the low windows proved to be the front of the huge room in which he spent his waking hours holmes pointed as we passed to the small brass plate which bore the curious name up some years watson he remarked indicating its discoloured surface its his real name anyhow and that is something to note the house had a common stair and there were a number of names painted in the hall some indicating offices and some private chambers it was not a collection of residential flats but rather the abode of bohemian bachelors our client opened the door for us himself and apologized by saying that the woman in charge left at four oclock mr nathan garrideb proved to be a very tall loosejointed roundbacked person gaunt and bald some sixtyodd years of age he had a cadaverous face with the dull dead skin of a man to whom exercise was unknown large round spectacles and a small projecting goats beard combined with his stooping attitude to give him an expression of peering curiosity the general effect however was amiable though eccentric the room was as curious as its occupant it looked like a small museum it was both broad and deep with cupboards and cabinets all round crowded with specimens geological and anatomical cases of butterflies and moths flanked each side of the entrance a large table in the centre was littered with all sorts of debris while the tall brass tube of a powerful microscope bristled up among them as i glanced round i was surprised at the universality of the mans interests here was a case of ancient coins there was a cabinet of flint instruments behind his central table was a large cupboard of fossil bones above was a line of plaster skulls with such names as neanderthal heidelberg cromagnon printed beneath them it was clear that he was a student of many subjects as he stood in front of us now he held a piece of chamois leather in his right hand with which he was polishing a coin syracusanof the best period he explained holding it up they degenerated greatly towards the end at their best i hold them supreme though some prefer the alexandrian school you will find a chair here mr holmes pray allow me to clear these bones and you sirah yes dr watsonif you would have the goodness to put the japanese vase to one side you see round me my little interests in life my doctor lectures me about never going out but why should i go out when i have so much to hold me here i can assure you that the adequate cataloguing of one of those cabinets would take me three good months holmes looked round him with curiosity but do you tell me that you never go out he said now and again i drive down to sothebys or christies otherwise i very seldom leave my room i am not too strong and my researches are very absorbing but you can imagine mr holmes what a terrific shockpleasant but terrificit was for me when i heard of this unparalleled good fortune it only needs one more garrideb to complete the matter and surely we can find one i had a brother but he is dead and female relatives are disqualified but there must surely be others in the world i had heard that you handled strange cases and that was why i sent to you of course this american gentleman is quite right and i should have taken his advice first but i acted for the best i think you acted very wisely indeed said holmes but are you really anxious to acquire an estate in america certainly not sir nothing would induce me to leave my collection but this gentleman has assured me that he will buy me out as soon as we have established our claim five million dollars was the sum named there are a dozen specimens in the market at the present moment which fill gaps in my collection and which i am unable to purchase for want of a few hundred pounds just think what i could do with five million dollars why i have the nucleus of a national collection i shall be the hans sloane of my age his eyes gleamed behind his great spectacles it was very clear that no pains would be spared by mr nathan garrideb in finding a namesake i merely called to make your acquaintance and there is no reason why i should interrupt your studies said holmes i prefer to establish personal touch with those with whom i do business there are few questions i need ask for i have your very clear narrative in my pocket and i filled up the blanks when this american gentleman called i understand that up to this week you were unaware of his existence that is so he called last tuesday did he tell you of our interview today yes he came straight back to me he had been very angry why should he be angry he seemed to think it was some reflection on his honour but he was quite cheerful again when he returned did he suggest any course of action no sir he did not has he had or asked for any money from you no sir never you see no possible object he has in view none except what he states did you tell him of our telephone appointment yes sir i did holmes was lost in thought i could see that he was puzzled have you any articles of great value in your collection no sir i am not a rich man it is a good collection but not a very valuable one you have no fear of burglars not the least how long have you been in these rooms nearly five years holmess crossexamination was interrupted by an imperative knocking at the door no sooner had our client unlatched it than the american lawyer burst excitedly into the room here you are he cried waving a paper over his head i thought i should be in time to get you mr nathan garrideb my congratulations you are a rich man sir our business is happily finished and all is well as to you mr holmes we can only say we are sorry if we have given you any useless trouble he handed over the paper to our client who stood staring at a marked advertisement holmes and i leaned forward and read it over his shoulder this is how it ran howard garrideb constructor of agricultural machinery binders reapers steam and hand plows drills harrows farmers carts buckboards and all other appliances estimates for artesian wells apply grosvenor buildings aston glorious gasped our host that makes our third man i had opened up inquiries in birmingham said the american and my agent there has sent me this advertisement from a local paper we must hustle and put the thing through i have written to this man and told him that you will see him in his office tomorrow afternoon at four oclock you want me to see him what do you say mr holmes dont you think it would be wiser here am i a wandering american with a wonderful tale why should he believe what i tell him but you are a britisher with solid references and he is bound to take notice of what you say i would go with you if you wished but i have a very busy day tomorrow and i could always follow you if you are in any trouble well i have not made such a journey for years it is nothing mr garrideb i have figured out our connections you leave at twelve and should be there soon after two then you can be back the same night all you have to do is to see this man explain the matter and get an affidavit of his existence by the lord he added hotly considering ive come all the way from the centre of america it is surely little enough if you go a hundred miles in order to put this matter through quite so said holmes i think what this gentleman says is very true mr nathan garrideb shrugged his shoulders with a disconsolate air well if you insist i shall go said he it is certainly hard for me to refuse you anything considering the glory of hope that you have brought into my life then that is agreed said holmes and no doubt you will let me have a report as soon as you can ill see to that said the american well he added looking at his watch ill have to get on ill call tomorrow mr nathan and see you off to birmingham coming my way mr holmes well then goodbye and we may have good news for you tomorrow night i noticed that my friends face cleared when the american left the room and the look of thoughtful perplexity had vanished i wish i could look over your collection mr garrideb said he in my profession all sorts of odd knowledge comes useful and this room of yours is a storehouse of it our client shone with pleasure and his eyes gleamed from behind his big glasses i had always heard sir that you were a very intelligent man said he i could take you round now if you have the time unfortunately i have not but these specimens are so well labelled and classified that they hardly need your personal explanation if i should be able to look in tomorrow i presume that there would be no objection to my glancing over them none at all you are most welcome the place will of course be shut up but mrs saunders is in the basement up to four oclock and would let you in with her key well i happen to be clear tomorrow afternoon if you would say a word to mrs saunders it would be quite in order by the way who is your houseagent our client was amazed at the sudden question holloway and steele in the edgware road but why i am a bit of an archaeologist myself when it comes to houses said holmes laughing i was wondering if this was queen anne or georgian georgian beyond doubt really i should have thought a little earlier however it is easily ascertained well goodbye mr garrideb and may you have every success in your birmingham journey the houseagents was close by but we found that it was closed for the day so we made our way back to baker street it was not till after dinner that holmes reverted to the subject our little problem draws to a close said he no doubt you have outlined the solution in your own mind i can make neither head nor tail of it the head is surely clear enough and the tail we should see tomorrow did you notice nothing curious about that advertisement i saw that the word plough was misspelt oh you did notice that did you come watson you improve all the time yes it was bad english but good american the printer had set it up as received then the buckboards that is american also and artesian wells are commoner with them than with us it was a typical american advertisement but purporting to be from an english firm what do you make of that i can only suppose that this american lawyer put it in himself what his object was i fail to understand well there are alternative explanations anyhow he wanted to get this good old fossil up to birmingham that is very clear i might have told him that he was clearly going on a wildgoose chase but on second thoughts it seemed better to clear the stage by letting him go tomorrow watsonwell tomorrow will speak for itself holmes was up and out early when he returned at lunchtime i noticed that his face was very grave this is a more serious matter than i had expected watson said he it is fair to tell you so though i know it will only be an additional reason to you for running your head into danger i should know my watson by now but there is danger and you should know it well it is not the first we have shared holmes i hope it may not be the last what is the particular danger this time we are up against a very hard case i have identified mr john garrideb counsellor at law he is none other than killer evans of sinister and murderous reputation i fear i am none the wiser ah it is not part of your profession to carry about a portable newgate calendar in your memory i have been down to see friend lestrade at the yard there may be an occasional want of imaginative intuition down there but they lead the world for thoroughness and method i had an idea that we might get on the track of our american friend in their records sure enough i found his chubby face smiling up at me from the rogues portrait gallery james winter alias morecroft alias killer evans was the inscription below holmes drew an envelope from his pocket i scribbled down a few points from his dossier aged fortyfour native of chicago known to have shot three men in the states escaped from penitentiary through political influence came to london in 1893 shot a man over cards in a nightclub in the waterloo road in january 1895 man died but he was shown to have been the aggressor in the row dead man was identified as rodger prescott famous as forger and coiner in chicago killer evans released in 1901 has been under police supervision since but so far as known has led an honest life very dangerous man usually carries arms and is prepared to use them that is our bird watsona sporting bird as you must admit but what is his game well it begins to define itself i have been to the houseagents our client as he told us has been there five years it was unlet for a year before then the previous tenant was a gentleman at large named waldron waldrons appearance was well remembered at the office he had suddenly vanished and nothing more been heard of him he was a tall bearded man with very dark features now prescott the man whom killer evans had shot was according to scotland yard a tall dark man with a beard as a working hypothesis i think we may take it that prescott the american criminal used to live in the very room which our innocent friend now devotes to his museum so at last we get a link you see and the next link well we must go now and look for that he took a revolver from the drawer and handed it to me i have my old favourite with me if our wild west friend tries to live up to his nickname we must be ready for him ill give you an hour for a siesta watson and then i think it will be time for our ryder street adventure it was just four oclock when we reached the curious apartment of nathan garrideb mrs saunders the caretaker was about to leave but she had no hesitation in admitting us for the door shut with a spring lock and holmes promised to see that all was safe before we left shortly afterwards the outer door closed her bonnet passed the bow window and we knew that we were alone in the lower floor of the house holmes made a rapid examination of the premises there was one cupboard in a dark corner which stood out a little from the wall it was behind this that we eventually crouched while holmes in a whisper outlined his intentions he wanted to get our amiable friend out of his roomthat is very clear and as the collector never went out it took some planning to do it the whole of this garrideb invention was apparently for no other end i must say watson that there is a certain devilish ingenuity about it even if the queer name of the tenant did give him an opening which he could hardly have expected he wove his plot with remarkable cunning but what did he want well that is what we are here to find out it has nothing whatever to do with our client so far as i can read the situation it is something connected with the man he murderedthe man who may have been his confederate in crime there is some guilty secret in the room that is how i read it at first i thought our friend might have something in his collection more valuable than he knewsomething worth the attention of a big criminal but the fact that rodger prescott of evil memory inhabited these rooms points to some deeper reason well watson we can but possess our souls in patience and see what the hour may bring that hour was not long in striking we crouched closer in the shadow as we heard the outer door open and shut then came the sharp metallic snap of a key and the american was in the room he closed the door softly behind him took a sharp glance around him to see that all was safe threw off his overcoat and walked up to the central table with the brisk manner of one who knows exactly what he has to do and how to do it he pushed the table to one side tore up the square of carpet on which it rested rolled it completely back and then drawing a jemmy from his inside pocket he knelt down and worked vigorously upon the floor presently we heard the sound of sliding boards and an instant later a square had opened in the planks killer evans struck a match lit a stump of candle and vanished from our view clearly our moment had come holmes touched my wrist as a signal and together we stole across to the open trapdoor gently as we moved however the old floor must have creaked under our feet for the head of our american peering anxiously round emerged suddenly from the open space his face turned upon us with a glare of baffled rage which gradually softened into a rather shamefaced grin as he realized that two pistols were pointed at his head well well said he coolly as he scrambled to the surface i guess you have been one too many for me mr holmes saw through my game i suppose and played me for a sucker from the first well sir i hand it to you you have me beat and in an instant he had whisked out a revolver from his breast and had fired two shots i felt a sudden hot sear as if a redhot iron had been pressed to my thigh there was a crash as holmess pistol came down on the mans head i had a vision of him sprawling upon the floor with blood running down his face while holmes rummaged him for weapons then my friends wiry arms were round me and he was leading me to a chair youre not hurt watson for gods sake say that you are not hurt it was worth a woundit was worth many woundsto know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask the clear hard eyes were dimmed for a moment and the firm lips were shaking for the one and only time i caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain all my years of humble but singleminded service culminated in that moment of revelation its nothing holmes its a mere scratch he had ripped up my trousers with his pocketknife you are right he cried with an immense sigh of relief it is quite superficial his face set like flint as he glared at our prisoner who was sitting up with a dazed face by the lord it is as well for you if you had killed watson you would not have got out of this room alive now sir what have you to say for yourself he had nothing to say for himself he only sat and scowled i leaned on holmess arm and together we looked down into the small cellar which had been disclosed by the secret flap it was still illuminated by the candle which evans had taken down with him our eyes fell upon a mass of rusted machinery great rolls of paper a litter of bottles and neatly arranged upon a small table a number of neat little bundles a printing pressa counterfeiters outfit said holmes yes sir said our prisoner staggering slowly to his feet and then sinking into the chair the greatest counterfeiter london ever saw thats prescotts machine and those bundles on the table are two thousand of prescotts notes worth a hundred each and fit to pass anywhere help yourselves gentlemen call it a deal and let me beat it holmes laughed we dont do things like that mr evans there is no bolthole for you in this country you shot this man prescott did you not yes sir and got five years for it though it was he who pulled on me five yearswhen i should have had a medal the size of a soup plate no living man could tell a prescott from a bank of england and if i hadnt put him out he would have flooded london with them i was the only one in the world who knew where he made them can you wonder that i wanted to get to the place and can you wonder that when i found this crazy boob of a bughunter with the queer name squatting right on the top of it and never quitting his room i had to do the best i could to shift him maybe i would have been wiser if i had put him away it would have been easy enough but im a softhearted guy that cant begin shooting unless the other man has a gun also but say mr holmes what have i done wrong anyhow ive not used this plant ive not hurt this old stiff where do you get me only attempted murder so far as i can see said holmes but thats not our job they take that at the next stage what we wanted at present was just your sweet self please give the yard a call watson it wont be entirely unexpected so those were the facts about killer evans and his remarkable invention of the three garridebs we heard later that our poor old friend never got over the shock of his dissipated dreams when his castle in the air fell down it buried him beneath the ruins he was last heard of at a nursinghome in brixton it was a glad day at the yard when the prescott outfit was discovered for though they knew that it existed they had never been able after the death of the man to find out where it was evans had indeed done great service and caused several worthy c i d men to sleep the sounder for the counterfeiter stands in a class by himself as a public danger they would willingly have subscribed to that soupplate medal of which the criminal had spoken but an unappreciative bench took a less favourable view and the killer returned to those shades from which he had just emerged
