the adventure of black peter arthur conan doyle i have
never known my friend to be in better form both
mental and physical than in the year number number his
increasing fame had brought with it an immense practice and
i should be guilty of an indiscretion if i were
even to hint at the identity of some of the
illustrious clients who crossed our humble threshold in baker street
holmes however like all great artists lived for his arts
sake and save in the case of the duke of
holdernesse i have seldom known him claim any large reward
for his inestimable services so unworldly was heor so capriciousthat
he frequently refused his help to the powerful and wealthy
where the problem made no appeal to his sympathies while
he would devote weeks of most intense application to the
affairs of some humble client whose case presented those strange
and dramatic qualities which appealed to his imagination and challenged
his ingenuity in this memorable year number number a curious
and incongruous succession of cases had engaged his attention ranging
from his famous investigation of the sudden death of cardinal
toscaan inquiry which was carried out by him at the
express desire of his holiness the popedown to his arrest
of wilson the notorious canarytrainer which removed a plaguespot from
the eastend of london close on the heels of these
two famous cases came the tragedy of woodmans lee and
the very obscure circumstances which surrounded the death of captain
peter carey no record of the doings of mr sherlock
holmes would be complete which did not include some account
of this very unusual affair during the first week of
july my friend had been absent so often and so
long from our lodgings that i knew he had something
on hand the fact that several roughlooking men called during
that time and inquired for captain basil made me understand
that holmes was working somewhere under one of the numerous
disguises and names with which he concealed his own formidable
identity he had at least five small refuges in different
parts of london in which he was able to change
his personality he said nothing of his business to me
and it was not my habit to force a confidence
the first positive sign which he gave me of the
direction which his investigation was taking was an extraordinary one
he had gone out before breakfast and i had sat
down to mine when he strode into the room his
hat upon his head and a huge barbedheaded spear tucked
like an umbrella under his arm good gracious holmes i
cried you dont mean to say that you have been
walking about london with that thing i drove to the
butchers and back the butchers and i return with an
excellent appetite there can be no question my dear watson
of the value of exercise before breakfast but i am
prepared to bet that you will not guess the form
that my exercise has taken i will not attempt it
he chuckled as he poured out the coffee if you
could have looked into allardyces back shop you would have
seen a dead pig swung from a hook in the
ceiling and a gentleman in his shirtsleeves furiously stabbing at
it with this weapon i was that energetic person and
i have satisfied myself that by no exertion of my
strength can i transfix the pig with a single blow
perhaps you would care to try not for worlds but
why were you doing this because it seemed to me
to have an indirect bearing upon the mystery of woodmans
lee ah hopkins i got your wire last night and
i have been expecting you come and join us our
visitor was an exceedingly alert man thirty years of age
dressed in a quiet tweed suit but retaining the erect
bearing of one who was accustomed to official uniform i
recognised him at once as stanley hopkins a young police
inspector for whose future holmes had high hopes while he
in turn professed the admiration and respect of a pupil
for the scientific methods of the famous amateur hopkinss brow
was clouded and he sat down with an air of
deep dejection no thank you sir i breakfasted before i
came round i spent the night in town for i
came up yesterday to report and what had you to
report failure sir absolute failure you have made no progress
none dear me i must have a look at the
matter i wish to heavens that you would mr holmes
its my first big chance and i am at my
wits end for goodness sake come down and lend me
a hand well well it just happens that i have
already read all the available evidence including the report of
the inquest with some care by the way what do
you make of that tobaccopouch found on the scene of
the crime is there no clue there hopkins looked surprised
it was the mans own pouch sir his initials were
inside it and it was of sealskinand he an old
sealer but he had no pipe no sir we could
find no pipe indeed he smoked very little and yet
he might have kept some tobacco for his friends no
doubt i only mention it because if i had been
handling the case i should have been inclined to make
that the startingpoint of my investigation however my friend dr
watson knows nothing of this matter and i should be
none the worse for hearing the sequence of events once
more just give us some short sketch of the essentials
stanley hopkins drew a slip of paper from his pocket
i have a few dates here which will give you
the career of the dead man captain peter carey he
was born in number number fifty years of age he
was a most daring and successful seal and whale fisher
in number number number number he commanded the steam sealer
sea unicorn of dundee he had then had several successful
voyages in succession and in the following year number number
number number he retired after that he travelled for some
years and finally he bought a small place called woodmans
lee near forest row in sussex there he has lived
for six years and there he died just a week
ago today there were some most singular points about the
man in ordinary life he was a strict puritana silent
gloomy fellow his household consisted of his wife his daughter
aged twenty and two female servants these last were continually
changing for it was never a very cheery situation and
sometimes it became past all bearing the man was an
intermittent drunkard and when he had the fit on him
he was a perfect fiend he has been known to
drive his wife and his daughter out of doors in
the middle of the night and flog them through the
park until the whole village outside the gates was aroused
by their screams he was summoned once for a savage
assault upon the old vicar who had called upon him
to remonstrate with him upon his conduct in short mr
holmes you would go far before you found a more
dangerous man than peter carey and i have heard that
he bore the same character when he commanded his ship
he was known in the trade as black peter and
the name was given him not only on account of
his swarthy features and the colour of his huge beard
but for the humours which were the terror of all
around him i need not say that he was loathed
and avoided by every one of his neighbours and that
i have not heard one single word of sorrow about
his terrible end you must have read in the account
of the inquest about the mans cabin mr holmes but
perhaps your friend here has not heard of it he
had built himself a wooden outhousehe always called it the
cabina few hundred yards from his house and it was
here that he slept every night it was a little
singleroomed hut sixteen feet by ten he kept the key
in his pocket made his own bed cleaned it himself
and allowed no other foot to cross the threshold there
are small windows on each side which were covered by
curtains and never opened one of these windows was turned
towards the high road and when the light burned in
it at night the folk used to point it out
to each other and wonder what black peter was doing
in there thats the window mr holmes which gave us
one of the few bits of positive evidence that came
out at the inquest you remember that a stonemason named
slater walking from forest row about one oclock in the
morningtwo days before the murderstopped as he passed the grounds
and looked at the square of light still shining among
the trees he swears that the shadow of a mans
head turned sideways was clearly visible on the blind and
that this shadow was certainly not that of peter carey
whom he knew well it was that of a bearded
man but the beard was short and bristled forwards in
a way very different from that of the captain so
he says but he had been two hours in the
publichouse and it is some distance from the road to
the window besides this refers to the monday and the
crime was done upon the wednesday on the tuesday peter
carey was in one of his blackest moods flushed with
drink and as savage as a dangerous wild beast he
roamed about the house and the women ran for it
when they heard him coming late in the evening he
went down to his own hut about two oclock the
following morning his daughter who slept with her window open
heard a most fearful yell from that direction but it
was no unusual thing for him to bawl and shout
when he was in drink so no notice was taken
on rising at seven one of the maids noticed that
the door of the hut was open but so great
was the terror which the man caused that it was
midday before anyone would venture down to see what had
become of him peeping into the open door they saw
a sight which sent them flying with white faces into
the village within an hour i was on the spot
and had taken over the case well i have fairly
steady nerves as you know mr holmes but i give
you my word that i got a shake when i
put my head into that little house it was droning
like a harmonium with the flies and bluebottles and the
floor and walls were like a slaughterhouse he had called
it a cabin and a cabin it was sure enough
for you would have thought that you were in a
ship there was a bunk at one end a seachest
maps and charts a picture of the sea unicorn a
line of logbooks on a shelf all exactly as one
would expect to find it in a captains room and
there in the middle of it was the man himself
his face twisted like a lost soul in torment and
his great brindled beard stuck upwards in his agony right
through his broad breast a steel harpoon had been driven
and it had sunk deep into the wood of the
wall behind him he was pinned like a beetle on
a card of course he was quite dead and had
been so from the instant that he had uttered that
last yell of agony i know your methods sir and
i applied them before i permitted anything to be moved
i examined most carefully the ground outside and also the
floor of the room there were no footmarks meaning that
you saw none i assure you sir that there were
none my good hopkins i have investigated many crimes but
i have never yet seen one which was committed by
a flying creature as long as the criminal remains upon
two legs so long must there be some indentation some
abrasion some trifling displacement which can be detected by the
scientific searcher it is incredible that this bloodbespattered room contained
no trace which could have aided us i understand however
from the inquest that there were some objects which you
failed to overlook the young inspector winced at my companions
ironical comments i was a fool not to call you
in at the time mr holmes however thats past praying
for now yes there were several objects in the room
which called for special attention one was the harpoon with
which the deed was committed it had been snatched down
from a rack on the wall two others remained there
and there was a vacant place for the third on
the stock was engraved ss sea unicorn dundee this seemed
to establish that the crime had been done in a
moment of fury and that the murderer had seized the
first weapon which came in his way the fact that
the crime was committed at two in the morning and
yet peter carey was fully dressed suggested that he had
an appointment with the murderer which is borne out by
the fact that a bottle of rum and two dirty
glasses stood upon the table yes said holmes i think
that both inferences are permissible was there any other spirit
but rum in the room yes there was a tantalus
containing brandy and whisky on the seachest it is of
no importance to us however since the decanters were full
and it had therefore not been used for all that
its presence has some significance said holmes however let us
hear some more about the objects which do seem to
you to bear upon the case there was this tobaccopouch
upon the table what part of the table it lay
in the middle it was of coarse sealskinthe straighthaired skin
with a leather thong to bind it inside was pc
on the flap there was half an ounce of strong
ships tobacco in it excellent what more stanley hopkins drew
from his pocket a drabcovered notebook the outside was rough
and worn the leaves discoloured on the first page were
written the initials jhn and the date number number number
number holmes laid it on the table and examined it
in his minute way while hopkins and i gazed over
each shoulder on the second page were the printed letters
cpr and then came several sheets of numbers another heading
was argentine another costa rica and another san paulo each
with pages of signs and figures after it what do
you make of these asked holmes they appear to be
lists of stock exchange securities i thought that jhn were
the initials of a broker and that cpr may have
been his client try canadian pacific railway said holmes stanley
hopkins swore between his teeth and struck his thigh with
his clenched hand what a fool i have been he
cried of course it is as you say then jhn
are the only initials we have to solve i have
already examined the old stock exchange lists and i can
find no one in number number number number either in
the house or among the outside brokers whose initials correspond
with these yet i feel that the clue is the
most important one that i hold you will admit mr
holmes that there is a possibility that these initials are
those of the second person who was presentin other words
of the murderer i would also urge that the introduction
into the case of a document relating to large masses
of valuable securities gives us for the first time some
indication of a motive for the crime sherlock holmess face
showed that he was thoroughly taken aback by this new
development i must admit both your points said he i
confess that this notebook which did not appear at the
inquest modifies any views which i may have formed i
had come to a theory of the crime in which
i can find no place for this have you endeavoured
to trace any of the securities here mentioned inquiries are
now being made at the offices but i fear that
the complete register of the stockholders of these south american
concerns is in south america and that some weeks must
elapse before we can trace the shares holmes had been
examining the cover of the notebook with his magnifying lens
surely there is some discolouration here said he yes sir
it is a bloodstain i told you that i picked
the book off the floor was the bloodstain above or
below on the side next the boards which proves of
course that the book was dropped after the crime was
committed exactly mr holmes i appreciated that point and i
conjectured that it was dropped by the murderer in his
hurried flight it lay near the door i suppose that
none of these securities have been found among the property
of the dead man no sir have you any reason
to suspect robbery no sir nothing seemed to have been
touched dear me it is certainly a very interesting case
then there was a knife was there not a sheathknife
still in its sheath it lay at the feet of
the dead man mrs carey has identified it as being
her husbands property holmes was lost in thought for some
time well said he at last i suppose i shall
have to come out and have a look at it
stanley hopkins gave a cry of joy thank you sir
that will indeed be a weight off my mind holmes
shook his finger at the inspector it would have been
an easier task a week ago said he but even
now my visit may not be entirely fruitless watson if
you can spare the time i should be very glad
of your company if you will call a fourwheeler hopkins
we shall be ready to start for forest row in
a quarter of an hour alighting at the small wayside
station we drove for some miles through the remains of
widespread woods which were once part of that great forest
which for so long held the saxon invaders at baythe
impenetrable weald for sixty years the bulwark of britain vast
sections of it have been cleared for this is the
seat of the first ironworks of the country and the
trees have been felled to smelt the ore now the
richer fields of the north have absorbed the trade and
nothing save these ravaged groves and great scars in the
earth show the work of the past here in a
clearing upon the green slope of a hill stood a
long low stone house approached by a curving drive running
through the fields nearer the road and surrounded on three
sides by bushes was a small outhouse one window and
the door facing in our direction it was the scene
of the murder stanley hopkins led us first to the
house where he introduced us to a haggard greyhaired woman
the widow of the murdered man whose gaunt and deeplined
face with the furtive look of terror in the depths
of her redrimmed eyes told of the years of hardship
and illusage which she had endured with her was her
daughter a pale fairhaired girl whose eyes blazed defiantly at
us as she told us that she was glad that
her father was dead and that she blessed the hand
which had struck him down it was a terrible household
that black peter carey had made for himself and it
was with a sense of relief that we found ourselves
in the sunlight again and making our way along a
path which had been worn across the fields by the
feet of the dead man the outhouse was the simplest
of dwellings woodenwalled shingleroofed one window beside the door and
one on the farther side stanley hopkins drew the key
from his pocket and had stooped to the lock when
he paused with a look of attention and surprise upon
his face someone has been tampering with it he said
there could be no doubt of the fact the woodwork
was cut and the scratches showed white through the paint
as if they had been that instant done holmes had
been examining the window someone has tried to force this
also whoever it was has failed to make his way
in he must have been a very poor burglar this
is a most extraordinary thing said the inspector i could
swear that these marks were not here yesterday evening some
curious person from the village perhaps i suggested very unlikely
few of them would dare to set foot in the
grounds far less try to force their way into the
cabin what do you think of it mr holmes i
think that fortune is very kind to us you mean
that the person will come again it is very probable
he came expecting to find the door open he tried
to get in with the blade of a very small
penknife he could not manage it what would he do
come again next night with a more useful tool so
i should say it will be our fault if we
are not there to receive him meanwhile let me see
the inside of the cabin the traces of the tragedy
had been removed but the furniture within the little room
still stood as it had been on the night of
the crime for two hours with most intense concentration holmes
examined every object in turn but his face showed that
his quest was not a successful one once only he
paused in his patient investigation have you taken anything off
this shelf hopkins no i have moved nothing something has
been taken there is less dust in this corner of
the shelf than elsewhere it may have been a book
lying on its side it may have been a box
well well i can do nothing more let us walk
in these beautiful woods watson and give a few hours
to the birds and the flowers we shall meet you
here later hopkins and see if we can come to
closer quarters with the gentleman who has paid this visit
in the night it was past eleven oclock when we
formed our little ambuscade hopkins was for leaving the door
of the hut open but holmes was of the opinion
that this would rouse the suspicions of the stranger the
lock was a perfectly simple one and only a strong
blade was needed to push it back holmes also suggested
that we should wait not inside the hut but outside
it among the bushes which grew round the farther window
in this way we should be able to watch our
man if he struck a light and see what his
object was in this stealthy nocturnal visit it was a
long and melancholy vigil and yet brought with it something
of the thrill which the hunter feels when he lies
beside the water pool and waits for the coming of
the thirsty beast of prey what savage creature was it
which might steal upon us out of the darkness was
it a fierce tiger of crime which could only be
taken fighting hard with flashing fang and claw or would
it prove to be some skulking jackal dangerous only to
the weak and unguarded in absolute silence we crouched amongst
the bushes waiting for whatever might come at first the
steps of a few belated villagers or the sound of
voices from the village lightened our vigil but one by
one these interruptions died away and an absolute stillness fell
upon us save for the chimes of the distant church
which told us of the progress of the night and
for the rustle and whisper of a fine rain falling
amid the foliage which roofed us in halfpast two had
chimed and it was the darkest hour which precedes the
dawn when we all started as a low but sharp
click came from the direction of the gate someone had
entered the drive again there was a long silence and
i had begun to fear that it was a false
alarm when a stealthy step was heard upon the other
side of the hut and a moment later a metallic
scraping and clinking the man was trying to force the
lock this time his skill was greater or his tool
was better for there was a sudden snap and the
creak of the hinges then a match was struck and
next instant the steady light from a candle filled the
interior of the hut through the gauze curtain our eyes
were all riveted upon the scene within the nocturnal visitor
was a young man frail and thin with a black
moustache which intensified the deadly pallor of his face he
could not have been much above twenty years of age
i have never seen any human being who appeared to
be in such a pitiable fright for his teeth were
visibly chattering and he was shaking in every limb he
was dressed like a gentleman in norfolk jacket and knickerbockers
with a cloth cap upon his head we watched him
staring round with frightened eyes then he laid the candleend
upon the table and disappeared from our view into one
of the corners he returned with a large book one
of the logbooks which formed a line upon the shelves
leaning on the table he rapidly turned over the leaves
of this volume until he came to the entry which
he sought then with an angry gesture of his clenched
hand he closed the book replaced it in the corner
and put out the light he had hardly turned to
leave the hut when hopkinss hand was on the fellows
collar and i heard his loud gasp of terror as
he understood that he was taken the candle was relit
and there was our wretched captive shivering and cowering in
the grasp of the detective he sank down upon the
seachest and looked helplessly from one of us to the
other now my fine fellow said stanley hopkins who are
you and what do you want here the man pulled
himself together and faced us with an effort at selfcomposure
you are detectives i suppose said he you imagine i
am connected with the death of captain peter carey i
assure you that i am innocent well see about that
said hopkins first of all what is your name it
is john hopley neligan i saw holmes and hopkins exchange
a quick glance what are you doing here can i
speak confidentially no certainly not why should i tell you
if you have no answer it may go badly with
you at the trial the young man winced well i
will tell you he said why should i not and
yet i hate to think of this old scandal gaining
a new lease of life did you ever hear of
dawson and neligan i could see from hopkinss face that
he never had but holmes was keenly interested you mean
the westcountry bankers said he they failed for a million
ruined half the county families of cornwall and neligan disappeared
exactly neligan was my father at last we were getting
something positive and yet it seemed a long gap between
an absconding banker and captain peter carey pinned against the
wall with one of his own harpoons we all listened
intently to the young mans words it was my father
who was really concerned dawson had retired i was only
ten years of age at the time but i was
old enough to feel the shame and horror of it
all it has always been said that my father stole
all the securities and fled it is not true it
was his belief that if he were given time in
which to realize them all would be well and every
creditor paid in full he started in his little yacht
for norway just before the warrant was issued for his
arrest i can remember that last night when he bade
farewell to my mother he left us a list of
the securities he was taking and he swore that he
would come back with his honour cleared and that none
who had trusted him would suffer well no word was
ever heard from him again both the yacht and he
vanished utterly we believed my mother and i that he
and it with the securities that he had taken with
him were at the bottom of the sea we had
a faithful friend however who is a business man and
it was he who discovered some time ago that some
of the securities which my father had with him have
reappeared on the london market you can imagine our amazement
i spent months in trying to trace them and at
last after many doublings and difficulties i discovered that the
original seller had been captain peter carey the owner of
this hut naturally i made some inquiries about the man
i found that he had been in command of a
whaler which was due to return from the arctic seas
at the very time when my father was crossing to
norway the autumn of that year was a stormy one
and there was a long succession of southerly gales my
fathers yacht may well have been blown to the north
and there met by captain peter careys ship if that
were so what had become of my father in any
case if i could prove from peter careys evidence how
these securities came on the market it would be a
proof that my father had not sold them and that
he had no view to personal profit when he took
them i came down to sussex with the intention of
seeing the captain but it was at this moment that
his terrible death occurred i read at the inquest a
description of his cabin in which it stated that the
old logbooks of his vessel were preserved in it it
struck me that if i could see what occurred in
the month of august number number number number on board
the sea unicorn i might settle the mystery of my
fathers fate i tried last night to get at these
logbooks but was unable to open the door tonight i
tried again and succeeded but i find that the pages
which deal with that month have been torn from the
book it was at that moment i found myself a
prisoner in your hands is that all asked hopkins yes
that is all his eyes shifted as he said it
you have nothing else to tell us he hesitated no
there is nothing you have not been here before last
night no then how do you account for that cried
hopkins as he held up the damning notebook with the
initials of our prisoner on the first leaf and the
bloodstain on the cover the wretched man collapsed he sank
his face in his hands and trembled all over where
did you get it he groaned i did not know
i thought i had lost it at the hotel that
is enough said hopkins sternly whatever else you have to
say you must say in court you will walk down
with me now to the policestation well mr holmes i
am very much obliged to you and to your friend
for coming down to help me as it turns out
your presence was unnecessary and i would have brought the
case to this successful issue without you but none the
less i am very grateful rooms have been reserved for
you at the brambletye hotel so we can all walk
down to the village together well watson what do you
think of it asked holmes as we travelled back next
morning i can see that you are not satisfied oh
yes my dear watson i am perfectly satisfied at the
same time stanley hopkinss methods do not commend themselves to
me i am disappointed in stanley hopkins i had hoped
for better things from him one should always look for
a possible alternative and provide against it it is the
first rule of criminal investigation what then is the alternative
the line of investigation which i have myself been pursuing
it may give us nothing i can not tell but
at least i shall follow it to the end several
letters were waiting for holmes at baker street he snatched
one of them up opened it and burst out into
a triumphant chuckle of laughter excellent watson the alternative develops
have you telegraph forms just write a couple of messages
for me sumner shipping agent ratcliff highway send three men
on to arrive ten tomorrow morningbasil thats my name in
those parts the other is inspector stanley hopkins number number
lord street brixton come breakfast tomorrow at ninethirty important wire
if unable to comesherlock holmes there watson this infernal case
has haunted me for ten days i hereby banish it
completely from my presence tomorrow i trust that we shall
hear the last of it for ever sharp at the
hour named inspector stanley hopkins appeared and we sat down
together to the excellent breakfast which mrs hudson had prepared
the young detective was in high spirits at his success
you really think that your solution must be correct asked
holmes i could not imagine a more complete case it
did not seem to me conclusive you astonish me mr
holmes what more could one ask for does your explanation
cover every point undoubtedly i find that young neligan arrived
at the brambletye hotel on the very day of the
crime he came on the pretence of playing golf his
room was on the groundfloor and he could get out
when he liked that very night he went down to
woodmans lee saw peter carey at the hut quarrelled with
him and killed him with the harpoon then horrified by
what he had done he fled out of the hut
dropping the notebook which he had brought with him in
order to question peter carey about these different securities you
may have observed that some of them were marked with
ticks and the othersthe great majoritywere not those which are
ticked have been traced on the london market but the
others presumably were still in the possession of carey and
young neligan according to his own account was anxious to
recover them in order to do the right thing by
his fathers creditors after his flight he did not dare
to approach the hut again for some time but at
last he forced himself to do so in order to
obtain the information which he needed surely that is all
simple and obvious holmes smiled and shook his head it
seems to me to have only one drawback hopkins and
that is that it is intrinsically impossible have you tried
to drive a harpoon through a body no tut tut
my dear sir you must really pay attention to these
details my friend watson could tell you that i spent
a whole morning in that exercise it is no easy
matter and requires a strong and practised arm but this
blow was delivered with such violence that the head of
the weapon sank deep into the wall do you imagine
that this anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an
assault is he the man who hobnobbed in rum and
water with black peter in the dead of the night
was it his profile that was seen on the blind
two nights before no no hopkins it is another and
a more formidable person for whom we must seek the
detectives face had grown longer and longer during holmess speech
his hopes and his ambitions were all crumbling about him
but he would not abandon his position without a struggle
you cant deny that neligan was present that night mr
holmes the book will prove that i fancy that i
have evidence enough to satisfy a jury even if you
are able to pick a hole in it besides mr
holmes i have laid my hand upon my man as
to this terrible person of yours where is he i
rather fancy that he is on the stair said holmes
serenely i think watson that you would do well to
put that revolver where you can reach it he rose
and laid a written paper upon a sidetable now we
are ready said he there had been some talking in
gruff voices outside and now mrs hudson opened the door
to say that there were three men inquiring for captain
basil show them in one by one said holmes the
first who entered was a little ribstonpippin of a man
with ruddy cheeks and fluffy white sidewhiskers holmes had drawn
a letter from his pocket what name he asked james
lancaster i am sorry lancaster but the berth is full
here is half a sovereign for your trouble just step
into this room and wait there for a few minutes
the second man was a long driedup creature with lank
hair and sallow cheeks his name was hugh pattins he
also received his dismissal his halfsovereign and the order to
wait the third applicant was a man of remarkable appearance
a fierce bulldog face was framed in a tangle of
hair and beard and two bold dark eyes gleamed behind
the cover of thick tufted overhung eyebrows he saluted and
stood sailorfashion turning his cap round in his hands your
name asked holmes patrick cairns harpooner yes sir twentysix voyages
dundee i suppose yes sir and ready to start with
an exploring ship yes sir what wages eight pounds a
month could you start at once as soon as i
get my kit have you your papers yes sir he
took a sheaf of worn and greasy forms from his
pocket holmes glanced over them and returned them you are
just the man i want said he heres the agreement
on the sidetable if you sign it the whole matter
will be settled the seaman lurched across the room and
took up the pen shall i sign here he asked
stooping over the table holmes leaned over his shoulder and
passed both hands over his neck this will do said
he i heard a click of steel and a bellow
like an enraged bull the next instant holmes and the
seaman were rolling on the ground together he was a
man of such gigantic strength that even with the handcuffs
which holmes had so deftly fastened upon his wrists he
would have very quickly overpowered my friend had hopkins and
i not rushed to his rescue only when i pressed
the cold muzzle of the revolver to his temple did
he at last understand that resistance was vain we lashed
his ankles with cord and rose breathless from the struggle
i must really apologize hopkins said sherlock holmes i fear
that the scrambled eggs are cold however you will enjoy
the rest of your breakfast all the better will you
not for the thought that you have brought your case
to a triumphant conclusion stanley hopkins was speechless with amazement
i dont know what to say mr holmes he blurted
out at last with a very red face it seems
to me that i have been making a fool of
myself from the beginning i understand now what i should
never have forgotten that i am the pupil and you
are the master even now i see what you have
done but i dont know how you did it or
what it signifies well well said holmes goodhumouredly we all
learn by experience and your lesson this time is that
you should never lose sight of the alternative you were
so absorbed in young neligan that you could not spare
a thought to patrick cairns the true murderer of peter
carey the hoarse voice of the seaman broke in on
our conversation see here mister said he i make no
complaint of being manhandled in this fashion but i would
have you call things by their right names you say
i murdered peter carey i say i killed peter carey
and theres all the difference maybe you dont believe what
i say maybe you think i am just slinging you
a yarn not at all said holmes let us hear
what you have to say its soon told and by
the lord every word of it is truth i knew
black peter and when he pulled out his knife i
whipped a harpoon through him sharp for i knew that
it was him or me thats how he died you
can call it murder anyhow id as soon die with
a rope round my neck as with black peters knife
in my heart how came you there asked holmes ill
tell it you from the beginning just sit me up
a little so as i can speak easy it was
in number number that it happenedaugust of that year peter
carey was master of the sea unicorn and i was
spare harpooner we were coming out of the icepack on
our way home with head winds and a weeks southerly
gale when we picked up a little craft that had
been blown north there was one man on hera landsman
the crew had thought she would founder and had made
for the norwegian coast in the dinghy i guess they
were all drowned well we took him on board this
man and he and the skipper had some long talks
in the cabin all the baggage we took off with
him was one tin box so far as i know
the mans name was never mentioned and on the second
night he disappeared as if he had never been it
was given out that he had either thrown himself overboard
or fallen overboard in the heavy weather that we were
having only one man knew what had happened to him
and that was me for with my own eyes i
saw the skipper tip up his heels and put him
over the rail in the middle watch of a dark
night two days before we sighted the shetland lights well
i kept my knowledge to myself and waited to see
what would come of it when we got back to
scotland it was easily hushed up and nobody asked any
questions a stranger died by an accident and it was
nobodys business to inquire shortly after peter carey gave up
the sea and it was long years before i could
find where he was i guessed that he had done
the deed for the sake of what was in that
tin box and that he could afford now to pay
me well for keeping my mouth shut i found out
where he was through a sailor man that had met
him in london and down i went to squeeze him
the first night he was reasonable enough and was ready
to give me what would make me free of the
sea for life we were to fix it all two
nights later when i came i found him three parts
drunk and in a vile temper we sat down and
we drank and we yarned about old times but the
more he drank the less i liked the look on
his face i spotted that harpoon upon the wall and
i thought i might need it before i was through
then at last he broke out at me spitting and
cursing with murder in his eyes and a great claspknife
in his hand he had not time to get it
from the sheath before i had the harpoon through him
heavens what a yell he gave and his face gets
between me and my sleep i stood there with his
blood splashing round me and i waited for a bit
but all was quiet so i took heart once more
i looked round and there was the tin box on
a shelf i had as much right to it as
peter carey anyhow so i took it with me and
left the hut like a fool i left my baccypouch
upon the table now ill tell you the queerest part
of the whole story i had hardly got outside the
hut when i heard someone coming and i hid among
the bushes a man came slinking along went into the
hut gave a cry as if he had seen a
ghost and legged it as hard as he could run
until he was out of sight who he was or
what he wanted is more than i can tell for
my part i walked ten miles got a train at
tunbridge wells and so reached london and no one the
wiser well when i came to examine the box i
found there was no money in it and nothing but
papers that i would not dare to sell i had
lost my hold on black peter and was stranded in
london without a shilling there was only my trade left
i saw these advertisements about harpooners and high wages so
i went to the shipping agents and they sent me
here thats all i know and i say again that
if i killed black peter the law should give me
thanks for i saved them the price of a hempen
rope a very clear statement said holmes rising and lighting
his pipe i think hopkins that you should lose no
time in conveying your prisoner to a place of safety
this room is not well adapted for a cell and
mr patrick cairns occupies too large a proportion of our
carpet mr holmes said hopkins i do not know how
to express my gratitude even now i do not understand
how you attained this result simply by having the good
fortune to get the right clue from the beginning it
is very possible if i had known about this notebook
it might have led away my thoughts as it did
yours but all i heard pointed in the one direction
the amazing strength the skill in the use of the
harpoon the rum and water the sealskin tobaccopouch with the
coarse tobaccoall these pointed to a seaman and one who
had been a whaler i was convinced that the initials
pc upon the pouch were a coincidence and not those
of peter carey since he seldom smoked and no pipe
was found in his cabin you remember that i asked
whether whisky and brandy were in the cabin you said
they were how many landsmen are there who would drink
rum when they could get these other spirits yes i
was certain it was a seaman and how did you
find him my dear sir the problem had become a
very simple one if it were a seaman it could
only be a seaman who had been with him on
the sea unicorn so far as i could learn he
had sailed in no other ship i spent three days
in wiring to dundee and at the end of that
time i had ascertained the names of the crew of
the sea unicorn in number number number number when i
found patrick cairns among the harpooners my research was nearing
its end i argued that the man was probably in
london and that he would desire to leave the country
for a time i therefore spent some days in the
eastend devised an arctic expedition put forth tempting terms for
harpooners who would serve under captain basiland behold the result
wonderful cried hopkins wonderful you must obtain the release of
young neligan as soon as possible said holmes i confess
that i think you owe him some apology the tin
box must be returned to him but of course the
securities which peter carey has sold are lost for ever
theres the cab hopkins and you can remove your man
if you want me for the trial my address and
that of watson will be somewhere in norwayill send particulars
later
