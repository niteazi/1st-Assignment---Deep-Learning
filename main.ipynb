      "     Here was a bit of professional business between two gentlemen, and\n",
      "     one of them must needs call in a detective! I saw him this morning,\n",

      "     equally vital for both of you. He knew that I had means of getting\n",

      "     He made his money in real estate, and afterwards in the wheat pit at\n",
      "     Chicago, but he spent it in buying up as much land as would make one\n",
      "     of your counties, lying along the Arkansas River, west of Fort Dodge.\n",
      "     It's grazing-land and lumber-land and arable-land and\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"He had no kith nor kin--or, if he had, I never heard of it. But he\n",
      "     took a kind of pride in the queerness of his name. That was what\n",
      "     brought us together. I was in the law at Topeka, and one day I had a\n",
      "     visit from the old man, and he was tickled to death to meet another\n",
      "     man with his own name. It was his pet fad, and he was dead set to\n",
      "     find out if there were any more Garridebs in the world. 'Find me\n",
      "     another!' said he. I told him I was a busy man and could not spend my\n",
      "     life hiking round the world in search of Garridebs. 'None the less,'\n",
      "     said he, 'that is just what you will do if things pan out as I\n",
      "     planned them.' I thought he was joking, but there was a powerful lot\n",
      "     of meaning in the words, as I was soon to discover.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"For he died within a year of saying them, and he left a will behind\n",
      "     him. It was the queerest will that has ever been filed in the State\n",
      "     of Kansas. His property was divided into three parts, and I was to\n",
      "     have one on condition that I found two Garridebs who would share the\n",
      "     remainder. It's five million dollars for each if it is a cent, but we\n",
      "     can't lay a finger on it until we all three stand in a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"It was so big a chance that I just let my legal practice slide and I\n",
      "     set forth looking for Garridebs. There is not one in the United\n",
      "     States. I went through it, sir, with a fine-toothed comb and never a\n",
      "     Garrideb could I catch. Then I tried the old country. Sure enough\n",
      "     there was the name in the London telephone directory. I went after\n",
      "     him two days ago and explained the whole matter to him. But he is a\n",
      "     lone man, like myself, with some women relations, but no men. It says\n",
      "     three adult men in the will. So you see we still have a vacancy, and\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Well, Watson,\" said Holmes with a smile, \"I said it was rather\n",

      "     sir--ah, yes, Dr. Watson--if you would have the goodness to put the\n",
      "     Japanese vase to one side. You see round me my little interests in\n",
      "     life. My doctor lectures me about never going out, but why should I\n",
      "     go out when I have so much to hold me here? I can assure you that the\n",
      "     adequate cataloguing of one of those cabinets would take me three\n",

      "\n",
      "     Holmes looked round him with curiosity.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Now and again I drive down to Sotheby's or Christie's. Otherwise I\n",
      "     very seldom leave my room. I am not too strong, and my researches are\n",
      "     very absorbing. But you can imagine, Mr. Holmes, what a terrific\n",
      "     shock--pleasant but terrific--it was for me when I heard of this\n",
      "     unparalleled good fortune. It only needs one more Garrideb to\n",
      "     complete the matter, and surely we can find one. I had a brother, but\n",
      "     he is dead, and female relatives are disqualified. But there must\n",
      "     surely be others in the world. I had heard that you handled strange\n",
      "     cases, and that was why I sent to you. Of course, this American\n",

      "     but I acted for the best.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "     it up as received. Then the buckboards. That is American also. And\n",
      "     artesian wells are commoner with them than with us. It was a typical\n",

      "     his dossier: Aged forty-four. Native of Chicago. Known to have shot\n",
      "     three men in the States. Escaped from penitentiary through political\n",
      "     influence. Came to London in 1893. Shot a man over cards in a\n",
      "     night-club in the Waterloo Road in January, 1895. Man died, but he\n",
      "     was shown to have been the aggressor in the row. Dead man was\n",
      "     identified as Rodger Prescott, famous as forger and coiner in\n",
      "     Chicago. Killer Evans released in 1901. Has been under police\n",
      "     supervision since, but so far as known has led an honest life. Very\n",
      "     dangerous man, usually carries arms and is prepared to use them. That\n",
      "     is our bird, Watson--a sporting bird, as you must admit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"But what is his game?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Well, it begins to define itself. I have been to the house-agent's.\n",
      "     Our client, as he told us, has been there five years. It was unlet\n",
      "     for a year before then. The previous tenant was a gentleman at large\n",
      "     named Waldron. Waldron's appearance was well remembered at the\n",
      "     office. He had suddenly vanished and nothing more been heard of him.\n",
      "     He was a tall, bearded man with very dark features. Now, Prescott,\n",
      "     the man whom Killer Evans had shot, was, according to Scotland Yard,\n",
      "     a tall, dark man with a beard. As a working hypothesis, I think we\n",
      "     may take it that Prescott, the American criminal, used to live in the\n",
      "     very room which our innocent friend now devotes to his museum. So at\n",
      "     last we get a link, you see.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Well, we must go now and look for that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     He took a revolver from the drawer and handed it to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I have my old favourite with me. If our Wild West friend tries to\n",
      "     live up to his nickname, we must be ready for him. I'll give you an\n",
      "     hour for a siesta, Watson, and then I think it will be time for our\n",
      "     Ryder Street adventure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     It was just four o'clock when we reached the curious apartment of\n",
      "     Nathan Garrideb. Mrs. Saunders, the caretaker, was about to leave,\n",
      "     but she had no hesitation in admitting us, for the door shut with a\n",
      "     spring lock, and Holmes promised to see that all was safe before we\n",
      "     left. Shortly afterwards the outer door closed, her bonnet passed the\n",
      "     bow window, and we knew that we were alone in the lower floor of the\n",
      "     house. Holmes made a rapid examination of the premises. There was one\n",
      "     cupboard in a dark corner which stood out a little from the wall. It\n",
      "     was behind this that we eventually crouched while Holmes in a whisper\n",
      "     outlined his intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"He wanted to get our amiable friend out of his room--that is very\n",
      "     clear, and, as the collector never went out, it took some planning to\n",
      "     do it. The whole of this Garrideb invention was apparently for no\n",
      "     other end. I must say, Watson, that there is a certain devilish\n",
      "     ingenuity about it, even if the queer name of the tenant did give him\n",
      "     an opening which he could hardly have expected. He wove his plot with\n",
      "     remarkable cunning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"But what did he want?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Well, that is what we are here to find out. It has nothing whatever\n",
      "     to do with our client, so far as I can read the situation. It is\n",
      "     something connected with the man he murdered--the man who may have\n",
      "     been his confederate in crime. There is some guilty secret in the\n",
      "     room. That is how I read it. At first I thought our friend might have\n",
      "     something in his collection more valuable than he knew--something\n",
      "     worth the attention of a big criminal. But the fact that Rodger\n",
      "     Prescott of evil memory inhabited these rooms points to some deeper\n",
      "     reason. Well, Watson, we can but possess our souls in patience and\n",
      "     see what the hour may bring.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     That hour was not long in striking. We crouched closer in the shadow\n",
      "     as we heard the outer door open and shut. Then came the sharp,\n",
      "     metallic snap of a key, and the American was in the room. He closed\n",
      "     the door softly behind him, took a sharp glance around him to see\n",
      "     that all was safe, threw off his overcoat, and walked up to the\n",
      "     central table with the brisk manner of one who knows exactly what he\n",
      "     has to do and how to do it. He pushed the table to one side, tore up\n",
      "     the square of carpet on which it rested, rolled it completely back,\n",
      "     and then, drawing a jemmy from his inside pocket, he knelt down and\n",
      "     worked vigorously upon the floor. Presently we heard the sound of\n",
      "     sliding boards, and an instant later a square had opened in the\n",
      "     planks. Killer Evans struck a match, lit a stump of candle, and\n",
      "     vanished from our view.\n",

      "     Clearly our moment had come. Holmes touched my wrist as a signal, and\n",

      "     however, the old floor must have creaked under our feet, for the head\n",
      "     of our American, peering anxiously round, emerged suddenly from the\n",
      "     open space. His face turned upon us with a glare of baffled rage,\n",
      "     which gradually softened into a rather shamefaced grin as he realized\n",
      "     that two pistols were pointed at his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Well, well!\" said he coolly as he scrambled to the surface. \"I guess\n",
      "     you have been one too many for me, Mr. Holmes. Saw through my game, I\n",
      "     suppose, and played me for a sucker from the first. Well, sir, I hand\n",

      "     been pressed to my thigh. There was a crash as Holmes's pistol came\n",
      "     down on the man's head. I had a vision of him sprawling upon the\n",
      "     floor with blood running down his face while Holmes rummaged him for\n",
      "     weapons. Then my friend's wiry arms were round me, and he was leading\n",

      "     loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard\n",
      "     eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For\n",
      "     the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as\n",
      "     of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service\n",

      "     He had nothing to say for himself. He only sat and scowled. I leaned\n",
      "     on Holmes's arm, and together we looked down into the small cellar\n",
      "     which had been disclosed by the secret flap. It was still illuminated\n",
      "     by the candle which Evans had taken down with him. Our eyes fell upon\n",
      "     a mass of rusted machinery, great rolls of paper, a litter of\n",
      "     bottles, and, neatly arranged upon a small table, a number of neat\n",

      "     sinking into the chair. \"The greatest counterfeiter London ever saw.\n",

      "     plate. No living man could tell a Prescott from a Bank of England,\n",
      "     and if I hadn't put him out he would have flooded London with them. I\n",
      "     was the only one in the world who knew where he made them. Can you\n",
      "     wonder that I wanted to get to the place? And can you wonder that\n",

      "     squatting right on the top of it, and never quitting his room, I had\n",
      "     to do the best I could to shift him? Maybe I would have been wiser if\n",
      "     I had put him away. It would have been easy enough, but I'm a\n",
      "     soft-hearted guy that can't begin shooting unless the other man has a\n",
      "     gun also. But say, Mr. Holmes, what have I done wrong, anyhow? I've\n",
      "     not used this plant. I've not hurt this old stiff. Where do you get\n",
      "     me?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "     imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I\n",
      "     found that it was all right. The only duplicate which existed, so far\n",
      "     as I knew, was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister, a man\n",
      "     who has looked after my room for ten years, and whose honesty is\n",
      "     absolutely above suspicion. I found that the key was indeed his, that\n",
      "     he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very\n",
      "     carelessly left the key in the door when he came out. His visit to my\n",

      "     forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other\n",

      "     consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"The moment I looked at my table I was aware that someone had\n",
      "     rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long slips. I had\n",
      "     left them all together. Now, I found that one of them was lying on\n",
      "     the floor, one was on the side table near the window, and the third\n",
      "     was where I had left it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     Holmes stirred for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third\n",
      "     where you left it,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Exactly, Mr. Holmes. You amaze me. How could you possibly know\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable\n",
      "     liberty of examining my papers. He denied it, however, with the\n",
      "     utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the\n",
      "     truth. The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key\n",
      "     in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the\n",
      "     papers. A large sum of money is at stake, for the scholarship is a\n",
      "     very valuable one, and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk\n",
      "     in order to gain an advantage over his fellows.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Bannister was very much upset by the incident. He had nearly fainted\n",

      "     gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while I\n",
      "     made a most careful examination of the room. I soon saw that the\n",
      "     intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled\n",
      "     papers. On the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil\n",
      "     which had been sharpened. A broken tip of lead was lying there also.\n",
      "     Evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Excellent!\" said Holmes, who was recovering his good-humour as his\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"This was not all. I have a new writing-table with a fine surface of\n",
      "     red leather. I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was\n",
      "     smooth and unstained. Now I found a clean cut in it about three\n",
      "     inches long--not a mere scratch, but a positive cut. Not only this,\n",
      "     but on the table I found a small ball of black dough, or clay, with\n",
      "     specks of something which looks like sawdust in it. I am convinced\n",
      "     that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers. There\n",
      "     were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity. I was at\n",
      "     my wits' ends, when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that\n",
      "     you were in the town, and I came straight round to put the matter\n",
      "     into your hands. Do help me, Mr. Holmes! You see my dilemma. Either I\n",
      "     must find the man or else the examination must be postponed until\n",
      "     fresh papers are prepared, and since this cannot be done without\n",
      "     explanation there will ensue a hideous scandal, which will throw a\n",
      "     cloud not only on the college, but on the University. Above all\n",

      "     recovered. You left him in a chair, you say; which chair?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"By the window there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I see. Near this little table. You can come in now. I have finished\n",
      "     with the carpet. Let us take the little table first. Of course, what\n",
      "     has happened is very clear. The man entered and took the papers,\n",
      "     sheet by sheet, from the central table. He carried them over to the\n",
      "     window table, because from there he could see if you came across the\n",
      "     courtyard, and so could effect an escape.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"As a matter of fact he could not,\" said Soames, \"for I entered by\n",
      "     the side door.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Ah, that's good! Well, anyhow, that was in his mind. Let me see the\n",
      "     three strips. No finger impressions--no! Well, he carried over this\n",
      "     one first and he copied it. How long would it take him to do that,\n",
      "     using every possible contraction? A quarter of an hour, not less.\n",
      "     Then he tossed it down and seized the next. He was in the midst of\n",
      "     that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat--very\n",
      "     hurried, since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell\n",
      "     you that he had been there. You were not aware of any hurrying feet\n",

      "     \"Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and had, as\n",
      "     you observe, to sharpen it again. This is of interest, Watson. The\n",
      "     pencil was not an ordinary one. It was above the usual size, with a\n",
      "     soft lead; the outer colour was dark blue, the maker's name was\n",
      "     printed in silver lettering, and the piece remaining is only about an\n",
      "     inch and a half long. Look for such a pencil, Mr. Soames, and you\n",
      "     have got your man. When I add that he possesses a large and very\n",
      "     blunt knife, you have an additional aid.\"\n",

      "     Mr. Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information. \"I\n",

      "     perceive. As you say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it.\n",
      "     Dear me, this is very interesting. And the cut--a positive tear, I\n",
      "     see. It began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole. I am\n",
      "     much indebted to you for directing my attention to this case, Mr.\n",

      "\n",
      "     As Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from some little rigidity and\n",

      "     \"Halloa! What's that? One of them seems restless enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"I should like to have a peep at each of them,\" said Holmes. \"Is it\n",
      "     possible?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"No difficulty in the world,\" Soames answered. \"This set of rooms is\n",
      "     quite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for visitors\n",
      "     to go over them. Come along, and I will personally conduct you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"No names, please!\" said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist's door. A\n",
      "     tall, flaxen-haired, slim young fellow opened it, and made us welcome\n",
      "     when he understood our errand. There were some really curious pieces\n",
      "     of mediaeval domestic architecture within. Holmes was so charmed with\n",
      "     one of them that he insisted on drawing it on his note-book, broke\n",
      "     his pencil, had to borrow one from our host, and finally borrowed a\n",
      "     knife to sharpen his own. The same curious accident happened to him\n",
      "     in the rooms of the Indian--a silent, little, hook-nosed fellow, who\n",
      "     eyed us askance and was obviously glad when Holmes's architectural\n",
      "     studies had come to an end. I could not see that in either case\n",
      "     Holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching. Only at the\n",
      "     third did our visit prove abortive. The outer door would not open to\n",
      "     our knock, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad\n",
      "     language came from behind it. \"I don't care who you are. You can go\n",
      "     to blazes!\" roared the angry voice. \"To-morrow's the exam, and I\n",
      "     won't be drawn by anyone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"A rude fellow,\" said our guide, flushing with anger as we withdrew\n",
      "     down the stair. \"Of course, he did not realize that it was I who was\n",
      "     knocking, but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous, and,\n",
      "     indeed, under the circumstances rather suspicious.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     Holmes's response was a curious one.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Can you tell me his exact height?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Really, Mr. Holmes, I cannot undertake to say. He is taller than the\n",
      "     Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist. I suppose five foot six would be\n",
      "     about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"That is very important,\" said Holmes. \"And now, Mr. Soames, I wish\n",
      "     you good-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay. \"Good gracious,\n",
      "     Mr. Holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt\n",
      "     fashion! You don't seem to realize the position. To-morrow is the\n",
      "     examination. I must take some definite action to-night. I cannot\n",
      "     allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been\n",
      "     tampered with. The situation must be faced.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You must leave it as it is. I shall drop round early to-morrow\n",
      "     morning and chat the matter over. It is possible that I may be in a\n",
      "     position then to indicate some course of action. Meanwhile you change\n",
      "     nothing--nothing at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Very good, Mr. Holmes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You can be perfectly easy in your mind. We shall certainly find some\n",

      "\n",
      "     When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up\n",

      "     invisible.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Well, Watson, what do you think of it?\" Holmes asked, as we came out\n",
      "     into the main street. \"Quite a little parlour game--sort of\n",
      "     three-card trick, is it not? There are your three men. It must be one\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"The foul-mouthed fellow at the top. He is the one with the worst\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"There is nothing in that. Many men do it when they are trying to\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"So would you if a flock of strangers came in on you when you were\n",
      "     preparing for an examination next day, and every moment was of value.\n",
      "     No, I see nothing in that. Pencils, too, and knives--all was\n",
      "     satisfactory. But that fellow does puzzle me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Who?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Why, Bannister, the servant. What's his game in the matter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"So he did me. That's the puzzling part. Why should a perfectly\n",
      "     honest man--well, well, here's a large stationer's. We shall begin\n",
      "     our researches here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     There were only four stationers of any consequence in the town, and\n",
      "     at each Holmes produced his pencil chips and bid high for a\n",
      "     duplicate. All were agreed that one could be ordered, but that it was\n",
      "     not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock. My\n",

      "     could, of course, dismiss. He could examine the papers in his own\n",
      "     office. The Indian I also thought nothing of. If the proofs were in a\n",
      "     roll he could not possibly know what they were. On the other hand, it\n",
      "     seemed an unthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the\n",
      "     room, and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the\n",
      "     table. I dismissed that. The man who entered knew that the papers\n",

      "     in broad daylight, under the eyes of all these opposite rooms, forced\n",
      "     himself through it. Such an idea was absurd. I was measuring how tall\n",
      "     a man would need to be in order to see as he passed what papers were\n",
      "     on the central table. I am six feet high, and I could do it with an\n",
      "     effort. No one less than that would have a chance. Already you see I\n",
      "     had reason to think that if one of your three students was a man of\n",
      "     unusual height he was the most worth watching of the three.\n",

      "     long-distance jumper. Then the whole thing came to me in an instant,\n",
      "     and I only needed certain corroborative proofs, which I speedily\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"What happened was this. This young fellow had employed his afternoon\n",

      "     aware, with several sharp spikes. As he passed your window he saw, by\n",
      "     means of his great height, these proofs upon your table, and\n",
      "     conjectured what they were. No harm would have been done had it not\n",
      "     been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been\n",
      "     left by the carelessness of your servant. A sudden impulse came over\n",
      "     him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs. It was not a\n",
      "     dangerous exploit, for he could always pretend that he had simply\n",
      "     looked in to ask a question.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Well, when he saw that they were indeed the proofs, it was then that\n",

      "     you put on that chair near the window?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Gloves,\" said the young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister. \"He put his gloves on the\n",
      "     chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy them. He\n",
      "     thought the tutor must return by the main gate, and that he would see\n",
      "     him. As we know, he came back by the side gate. Suddenly he heard him\n",
      "     at the very door. There was no possible escape. He forgot his gloves,\n",
      "     but he caught up his shoes and darted into the bedroom. You observe\n",
      "     that the scratch on that table is slight at one side, but deepens in\n",
      "     the direction of the bedroom door. That in itself is enough to show\n",
      "     us that the shoe had been drawn in that direction and that the\n",
      "     culprit had taken refuge there. The earth round the spike had been\n",
      "     left on the table, and a second sample was loosened and fell in the\n",
      "     bedroom. I may add that I walked out to the athletic grounds this\n",
      "     morning, saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping-pit,\n",
      "     and carried away a specimen of it, together with some of the fine tan\n",
      "     or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete from\n",
      "     slipping. Have I told the truth, Mr. Gilchrist?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has\n",
      "     bewildered me. I have a letter here, Mr. Soames, which I wrote to you\n",
      "     early this morning in the middle of a restless night. It was before I\n",
      "     knew that my sin had found me out. Here it is, sir. You will see that\n",
      "     I have said, 'I have determined not to go in for the examination. I\n",
      "     have been offered a commission in the Rhodesian Police, and I am\n",
      "     going out to South Africa at once.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit by\n",

      "     \"There is the man who set me in the right path,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Come now, Bannister,\" said Holmes. \"It will be clear to you from\n",
      "     what I have said that only you could have let this young man out,\n",
      "     since you were left in the room, and must have locked the door when\n",
      "     you went out. As to his escaping by that window, it was incredible.\n",
      "     Can you not clear up the last point in this mystery, and tell us the\n",
      "     reasons for your action?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"It was simple enough, sir, if you only had known; but with all your\n",
      "     cleverness it was impossible that you could know. Time was, sir, when\n",
      "     I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young gentleman's\n",
      "     father. When he was ruined I came to the college as servant, but I\n",
      "     never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world. I\n",
      "     watched his son all I could for the sake of the old days. Well, sir,\n",
      "     when I came into this room yesterday when the alarm was given, the\n",
      "     very first thing I saw was Mr. Gilchrist's tan gloves a-lying in that\n",
      "     chair. I knew those gloves well, and I understood their message. If\n",
      "     Mr. Soames saw them the game was up. I flopped down into that chair,\n",
      "     and nothing would budge me until Mr. Soames he went for you. Then out\n",
      "     came my poor young master, whom I had dandled on my knee, and\n",
      "     confessed it all to me. Wasn't it natural, sir, that I should save\n",
      "     him, and wasn't it natural also that I should try to speak to him as\n",
      "     his dead father would have done, and make him understand that he\n",
      "     could not profit by such a deed? Could you blame me, sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"No, indeed,\" said Holmes, heartily, springing to his feet. \"Well,\n",
      "     Soames, I think we have cleared your little problem up, and our\n",

reason it cost me a bloodletting and it cost yet another     man the penalties of the law yet there was certainly an element of     comedy well you shall judge for yourselves     i remember the date very well for it was in the same month that     holmes refused a knighthood for services which may perhaps some day     be described i only refer to the matter in passing for in my     position of partner and confidant i am obliged to be particularly     careful to avoid any indiscretion i repeat however that this     enables me to fix the date which was the latter end of june 1902     shortly after the conclusion of the south african war holmes had     spent several days in bed as was his habit from time to time but he     emerged that morning with a long foolscap document in his hand and a     twinkle of amusement in his austere gray eyes     there is a chance for you to make some money friend watson said     he have you ever heard the name of garrideb     i admitted that i had not     well if you can lay your hand upon a garrideb theres money in     it     why     ah thats a long storyrather a whimsical one too i dont think     in all our explorations of human complexities we have ever come upon     anything more singular the fellow will be here presently for     crossexamination so i wont open the matter up till he comes but     meanwhile thats the name we want     the telephone directory lay on the table beside me and i turned over     the pages in a rather hopeless quest but to my amazement there was     this strange name in its due place i gave a cry of triumph     here you are holmes here it is     holmes took the book from my hand     garrideb n  he read 136 little ryder street w sorry to     disappoint you my dear watson but this is the man himself that is     the address upon his letter we want another to match him     mrs hudson had come in with a card upon a tray i took it up and     glanced at it     why here it is i cried in amazement this is a different     initial john garrideb counsellor at law moorville kansas u s     a     holmes smiled as he looked at the card i am afraid you must make     yet another effort watson said he this gentleman is also in the     plot already though i certainly did not expect to see him this     morning however he is in a position to tell us a good deal which i     want to know     a moment later he was in the room mr john garrideb counsellor at     law was a short powerful man with the round fresh cleanshaven     face characteristic of so many american men of affairs the general     effect was chubby and rather childlike so that one received the     impression of quite a young man with a broad set smile upon his face     his eyes however were arresting seldom in any human head have i     seen a pair which bespoke a more intense inward life so bright were     they so alert so responsive to every change of thought his accent     was american but was not accompanied by any eccentricity of speech     mr holmes he asked glancing from one to the other ah yes     your pictures are not unlike you sir if i may say so i believe you     have had a letter from my namesake mr nathan garrideb have you     not     pray sit down said sherlock holmes we shall i fancy have a     good deal to discuss he took up his sheets of foolscap you are     of course the mr john garrideb mentioned in this document but     surely you have been in england some time     why do you say that mr holmes i seemed to read sudden suspicion     in those expressive eyes     your whole outfit is english     mr garrideb forced a laugh ive read of your tricks mr holmes     but i never thought i would be the subject of them where do you read     that     the shoulder cut of your coat the toes of your bootscould anyone     doubt it     well well i had no idea i was so obvious a britisher but business     brought me over here some time ago and so as you say my outfit is     nearly all london however i guess your time is of value and we did     not meet to talk about the cut of my socks what about getting down     to that paper you hold in your hand     holmes had in some way ruffled our visitor whose chubby face had     assumed a far less amiable expression     patience patience mr garrideb said my friend in a soothing     voice dr watson would tell you that these little digressions of     mine sometimes prove in the end to have some bearing on the matter     but why did mr nathan garrideb not come with you     why did he ever drag you into it at all asked our visitor with a     sudden outflame of anger what in thunder had you to do with it     here was a bit of professional business between two gentlemen and     one of them must needs call in a detective i saw him this morning     and he told me this fooltrick he had played me and thats why i am     here but i feel bad about it all the same     there was no reflection upon you mr garrideb it was simply zeal     upon his part to gain your endan end which is i understand     equally vital for both of you he knew that i had means of getting     information and therefore it was very natural that he should apply     to me     our visitors angry face gradually cleared     well that puts it different said he when i went to see him this     morning and he told me he had sent to a detective i just asked for     your address and came right away i dont want police butting into a     private matter but if you are content just to help us find the man     there can be no harm in that     well that is just how it stands said holmes and now sir since     you are here we had best have a clear account from your own lips my     friend here knows nothing of the details     mr garrideb surveyed me with not too friendly a gaze     need he know he asked     we usually work together     well theres no reason it should be kept a secret ill give you     the facts as short as i can make them if you came from kansas i     would not need to explain to you who alexander hamilton garrideb was     he made his money in real estate and afterwards in the wheat pit at     chicago but he spent it in buying up as much land as would make one     of your counties lying along the arkansas river west of fort dodge     its grazingland and lumberland and arableland and     mineralizedland and just every sort of land that brings dollars to     the man that owns it     he had no kith nor kinor if he had i never heard of it but he     took a kind of pride in the queerness of his name that was what     brought us together i was in the law at topeka and one day i had a     visit from the old man and he was tickled to death to meet another     man with his own name it was his pet fad and he was dead set to     find out if there were any more garridebs in the world find me     another said he i told him i was a busy man and could not spend my     life hiking round the world in search of garridebs none the less     said he that is just what you will do if things pan out as i     planned them i thought he was joking but there was a powerful lot     of meaning in the words as i was soon to discover     for he died within a year of saying them and he left a will behind     him it was the queerest will that has ever been filed in the state     of kansas his property was divided into three parts and i was to     have one on condition that i found two garridebs who would share the     remainder its five million dollars for each if it is a cent but we     cant lay a finger on it until we all three stand in a row     it was so big a chance that i just let my legal practice slide and i     set forth looking for garridebs there is not one in the united     states i went through it sir with a finetoothed comb and never a     garrideb could i catch then i tried the old country sure enough     there was the name in the london telephone directory i went after     him two days ago and explained the whole matter to him but he is a     lone man like myself with some women relations but no men it says     three adult men in the will so you see we still have a vacancy and     if you can help to fill it we will be very ready to pay your     charges     well watson said holmes with a smile i said it was rather     whimsical did i not i should have thought sir that your obvious     way was to advertise in the agony columns of the papers     i have done that mr holmes no replies     dear me well it is certainly a most curious little problem i may     take a glance at it in my leisure by the way it is curious that you     should have come from topeka i used to have a correspondenthe is     dead nowold dr lysander starr who was mayor in 1890     good old dr starr said our visitor his name is still honoured     well mr holmes i suppose all we can do is to report to you and let     you know how we progress i reckon you will hear within a day or     two with this assurance our american bowed and departed     holmes had lit his pipe and he sat for some time with a curious     smile upon his face     well i asked at last     i am wondering watsonjust wondering     at what     holmes took his pipe from his lips     i was wondering watson what on earth could be the object of this     man in telling us such a rigmarole of lies i nearly asked him     sofor there are times when a brutal frontal attack is the best     policybut i judged it better to let him think he had fooled us     here is a man with an english coat frayed at the elbow and trousers     bagged at the knee with a years wear and yet by this document and     by his own account he is a provincial american lately landed in     london there have been no advertisements in the agony columns you     know that i miss nothing there they are my favourite covert for     putting up a bird and i would never have overlooked such a cock     pheasant as that i never knew a dr lysander starr of topeka touch     him where you would he was false i think the fellow is really an     american but he has worn his accent smooth with years of london     what is his game then and what motive lies behind this preposterous     search for garridebs its worth our attention for granting that     the man is a rascal he is certainly a complex and ingenious one we     must now find out if our other correspondent is a fraud also just     ring him up watson     i did so and heard a thin quavering voice at the other end of the     line     yes yes i am mr nathan garrideb is mr holmes there i should     very much like to have a word with mr holmes     my friend took the instrument and i heard the usual syncopated     dialogue     yes he has been here i understand that you dont know him  how     long  only two days  yes yes of course it is a most     captivating prospect will you be at home this evening i suppose     your namesake will not be there  very good we will come then     for i would rather have a chat without him  dr watson will come     with me  i understand from your note that you did not go out     often  well we shall be round about six you need not mention it     to the american lawyer  very good goodbye     it was twilight of a lovely spring evening and even little ryder     street one of the smaller offshoots from the edgware road within a     stonecast of old tyburn tree of evil memory looked golden and     wonderful in the slanting rays of the setting sun the particular     house to which we were directed was a large oldfashioned early     georgian edifice with a flat brick face broken only by two deep bay     windows on the ground floor it was on this ground floor that our     client lived and indeed the low windows proved to be the front of     the huge room in which he spent his waking hours holmes pointed as     we passed to the small brass plate which bore the curious name     up some years watson he remarked indicating its discoloured     surface its his real name anyhow and that is something to note     the house had a common stair and there were a number of names     painted in the hall some indicating offices and some private     chambers it was not a collection of residential flats but rather     the abode of bohemian bachelors our client opened the door for us     himself and apologized by saying that the woman in charge left at     four oclock mr nathan garrideb proved to be a very tall     loosejointed roundbacked person gaunt and bald some sixtyodd     years of age he had a cadaverous face with the dull dead skin of a     man to whom exercise was unknown large round spectacles and a small     projecting goats beard combined with his stooping attitude to give     him an expression of peering curiosity the general effect however     was amiable though eccentric     the room was as curious as its occupant it looked like a small     museum it was both broad and deep with cupboards and cabinets all     round crowded with specimens geological and anatomical cases of     butterflies and moths flanked each side of the entrance a large     table in the centre was littered with all sorts of debris while the     tall brass tube of a powerful microscope bristled up among them as i     glanced round i was surprised at the universality of the mans     interests here was a case of ancient coins there was a cabinet of     flint instruments behind his central table was a large cupboard of     fossil bones above was a line of plaster skulls with such names as     neanderthal heidelberg cromagnon printed beneath them it     was clear that he was a student of many subjects as he stood in     front of us now he held a piece of chamois leather in his right hand     with which he was polishing a coin     syracusanof the best period he explained holding it up they     degenerated greatly towards the end at their best i hold them     supreme though some prefer the alexandrian school you will find a     chair here mr holmes pray allow me to clear these bones and you     sirah yes dr watsonif you would have the goodness to put the     japanese vase to one side you see round me my little interests in     life my doctor lectures me about never going out but why should i     go out when i have so much to hold me here i can assure you that the     adequate cataloguing of one of those cabinets would take me three     good months     holmes looked round him with curiosity     but do you tell me that you never go out he said     now and again i drive down to sothebys or christies otherwise i     very seldom leave my room i am not too strong and my researches are     very absorbing but you can imagine mr holmes what a terrific     shockpleasant but terrificit was for me when i heard of this     unparalleled good fortune it only needs one more garrideb to     complete the matter and surely we can find one i had a brother but     he is dead and female relatives are disqualified but there must     surely be others in the world i had heard that you handled strange     cases and that was why i sent to you of course this american     gentleman is quite right and i should have taken his advice first     but i acted for the best     i think you acted very wisely indeed said holmes but are you     really anxious to acquire an estate in america     certainly not sir nothing would induce me to leave my collection     but this gentleman has assured me that he will buy me out as soon as     we have established our claim five million dollars was the sum     named there are a dozen specimens in the market at the present     moment which fill gaps in my collection and which i am unable to     purchase for want of a few hundred pounds just think what i could do     with five million dollars why i have the nucleus of a national     collection i shall be the hans sloane of my age     his eyes gleamed behind his great spectacles it was very clear that     no pains would be spared by mr nathan garrideb in finding a     namesake     i merely called to make your acquaintance and there is no reason     why i should interrupt your studies said holmes i prefer to     establish personal touch with those with whom i do business there     are few questions i need ask for i have your very clear narrative in     my pocket and i filled up the blanks when this american gentleman     called i understand that up to this week you were unaware of his     existence     that is so he called last tuesday     did he tell you of our interview today     yes he came straight back to me he had been very angry     why should he be angry     he seemed to think it was some reflection on his honour but he was     quite cheerful again when he returned     did he suggest any course of action     no sir he did not     has he had or asked for any money from you     no sir never     you see no possible object he has in view     none except what he states     did you tell him of our telephone appointment     yes sir i did     holmes was lost in thought i could see that he was puzzled     have you any articles of great value in your collection     no sir i am not a rich man it is a good collection but not a     very valuable one     you have no fear of burglars     not the least     how long have you been in these rooms     nearly five years     holmess crossexamination was interrupted by an imperative knocking     at the door no sooner had our client unlatched it than the american     lawyer burst excitedly into the room     here you are he cried waving a paper over his head i thought i     should be in time to get you mr nathan garrideb my     congratulations you are a rich man sir our business is happily     finished and all is well as to you mr holmes we can only say we     are sorry if we have given you any useless trouble     he handed over the paper to our client who stood staring at a marked     advertisement holmes and i leaned forward and read it over his     shoulder this is how it ran                                 howard garrideb                      constructor of agricultural machinery        binders reapers steam and hand plows drills harrows farmers                  carts buckboards and all other appliances                          estimates for artesian wells                        apply grosvenor buildings aston     glorious gasped our host that makes our third man     i had opened up inquiries in birmingham said the american and my     agent there has sent me this advertisement from a local paper we     must hustle and put the thing through i have written to this man and     told him that you will see him in his office tomorrow afternoon at     four oclock     you want me to see him     what do you say mr holmes dont you think it would be wiser here     am i a wandering american with a wonderful tale why should he     believe what i tell him but you are a britisher with solid     references and he is bound to take notice of what you say i would     go with you if you wished but i have a very busy day tomorrow and     i could always follow you if you are in any trouble     well i have not made such a journey for years     it is nothing mr garrideb i have figured out our connections you     leave at twelve and should be there soon after two then you can be     back the same night all you have to do is to see this man explain     the matter and get an affidavit of his existence by the lord he     added hotly considering ive come all the way from the centre of     america it is surely little enough if you go a hundred miles in     order to put this matter through     quite so said holmes i think what this gentleman says is very     true     mr nathan garrideb shrugged his shoulders with a disconsolate air     well if you insist i shall go said he it is certainly hard for     me to refuse you anything considering the glory of hope that you     have brought into my life     then that is agreed said holmes and no doubt you will let me     have a report as soon as you can     ill see to that said the american well he added looking at     his watch ill have to get on ill call tomorrow mr nathan and     see you off to birmingham coming my way mr holmes well then     goodbye and we may have good news for you tomorrow night     i noticed that my friends face cleared when the american left the     room and the look of thoughtful perplexity had vanished     i wish i could look over your collection mr garrideb said he     in my profession all sorts of odd knowledge comes useful and this     room of yours is a storehouse of it     our client shone with pleasure and his eyes gleamed from behind his     big glasses     i had always heard sir that you were a very intelligent man said     he i could take you round now if you have the time     unfortunately i have not but these specimens are so well labelled     and classified that they hardly need your personal explanation if i     should be able to look in tomorrow i presume that there would be no     objection to my glancing over them     none at all you are most welcome the place will of course be     shut up but mrs saunders is in the basement up to four oclock and     would let you in with her key     well i happen to be clear tomorrow afternoon if you would say a     word to mrs saunders it would be quite in order by the way who is     your houseagent     our client was amazed at the sudden question     holloway and steele in the edgware road but why     i am a bit of an archaeologist myself when it comes to houses said     holmes laughing i was wondering if this was queen anne or     georgian     georgian beyond doubt     really i should have thought a little earlier however it is     easily ascertained well goodbye mr garrideb and may you have     every success in your birmingham journey     the houseagents was close by but we found that it was closed for     the day so we made our way back to baker street it was not till     after dinner that holmes reverted to the subject     our little problem draws to a close said he no doubt you have     outlined the solution in your own mind     i can make neither head nor tail of it     the head is surely clear enough and the tail we should see     tomorrow did you notice nothing curious about that advertisement     i saw that the word plough was misspelt     oh you did notice that did you come watson you improve all the     time yes it was bad english but good american the printer had set     it up as received then the buckboards that is american also and     artesian wells are commoner with them than with us it was a typical     american advertisement but purporting to be from an english firm     what do you make of that     i can only suppose that this american lawyer put it in himself what     his object was i fail to understand     well there are alternative explanations anyhow he wanted to get     this good old fossil up to birmingham that is very clear i might     have told him that he was clearly going on a wildgoose chase but     on second thoughts it seemed better to clear the stage by letting     him go tomorrow watsonwell tomorrow will speak for itself     holmes was up and out early when he returned at lunchtime i noticed     that his face was very grave     this is a more serious matter than i had expected watson said he     it is fair to tell you so though i know it will only be an     additional reason to you for running your head into danger i should     know my watson by now but there is danger and you should know it     well it is not the first we have shared holmes i hope it may not     be the last what is the particular danger this time     we are up against a very hard case i have identified mr john     garrideb counsellor at law he is none other than killer evans of     sinister and murderous reputation     i fear i am none the wiser     ah it is not part of your profession to carry about a portable     newgate calendar in your memory i have been down to see friend     lestrade at the yard there may be an occasional want of imaginative     intuition down there but they lead the world for thoroughness and     method i had an idea that we might get on the track of our american     friend in their records sure enough i found his chubby face smiling     up at me from the rogues portrait gallery james winter alias     morecroft alias killer evans was the inscription below holmes     drew an envelope from his pocket i scribbled down a few points from     his dossier aged fortyfour native of chicago known to have shot     three men in the states escaped from penitentiary through political     influence came to london in 1893 shot a man over cards in a     nightclub in the waterloo road in january 1895 man died but he     was shown to have been the aggressor in the row dead man was     identified as rodger prescott famous as forger and coiner in     chicago killer evans released in 1901 has been under police     supervision since but so far as known has led an honest life very     dangerous man usually carries arms and is prepared to use them that     is our bird watsona sporting bird as you must admit     but what is his game     well it begins to define itself i have been to the houseagents     our client as he told us has been there five years it was unlet     for a year before then the previous tenant was a gentleman at large     named waldron waldrons appearance was well remembered at the     office he had suddenly vanished and nothing more been heard of him     he was a tall bearded man with very dark features now prescott     the man whom killer evans had shot was according to scotland yard     a tall dark man with a beard as a working hypothesis i think we     may take it that prescott the american criminal used to live in the     very room which our innocent friend now devotes to his museum so at     last we get a link you see     and the next link     well we must go now and look for that     he took a revolver from the drawer and handed it to me     i have my old favourite with me if our wild west friend tries to     live up to his nickname we must be ready for him ill give you an     hour for a siesta watson and then i think it will be time for our     ryder street adventure     it was just four oclock when we reached the curious apartment of     nathan garrideb mrs saunders the caretaker was about to leave     but she had no hesitation in admitting us for the door shut with a     spring lock and holmes promised to see that all was safe before we     left shortly afterwards the outer door closed her bonnet passed the     bow window and we knew that we were alone in the lower floor of the     house holmes made a rapid examination of the premises there was one     cupboard in a dark corner which stood out a little from the wall it     was behind this that we eventually crouched while holmes in a whisper     outlined his intentions     he wanted to get our amiable friend out of his roomthat is very     clear and as the collector never went out it took some planning to     do it the whole of this garrideb invention was apparently for no     other end i must say watson that there is a certain devilish     ingenuity about it even if the queer name of the tenant did give him     an opening which he could hardly have expected he wove his plot with     remarkable cunning     but what did he want     well that is what we are here to find out it has nothing whatever     to do with our client so far as i can read the situation it is     something connected with the man he murderedthe man who may have     been his confederate in crime there is some guilty secret in the     room that is how i read it at first i thought our friend might have     something in his collection more valuable than he knewsomething     worth the attention of a big criminal but the fact that rodger     prescott of evil memory inhabited these rooms points to some deeper     reason well watson we can but possess our souls in patience and     see what the hour may bring     that hour was not long in striking we crouched closer in the shadow     as we heard the outer door open and shut then came the sharp     metallic snap of a key and the american was in the room he closed     the door softly behind him took a sharp glance around him to see     that all was safe threw off his overcoat and walked up to the     central table with the brisk manner of one who knows exactly what he     has to do and how to do it he pushed the table to one side tore up     the square of carpet on which it rested rolled it completely back     and then drawing a jemmy from his inside pocket he knelt down and     worked vigorously upon the floor presently we heard the sound of     sliding boards and an instant later a square had opened in the     planks killer evans struck a match lit a stump of candle and     vanished from our view     clearly our moment had come holmes touched my wrist as a signal and     together we stole across to the open trapdoor gently as we moved     however the old floor must have creaked under our feet for the head     of our american peering anxiously round emerged suddenly from the     open space his face turned upon us with a glare of baffled rage     which gradually softened into a rather shamefaced grin as he realized     that two pistols were pointed at his head     well well said he coolly as he scrambled to the surface i guess     you have been one too many for me mr holmes saw through my game i     suppose and played me for a sucker from the first well sir i hand     it to you you have me beat and     in an instant he had whisked out a revolver from his breast and had     fired two shots i felt a sudden hot sear as if a redhot iron had     been pressed to my thigh there was a crash as holmess pistol came     down on the mans head i had a vision of him sprawling upon the     floor with blood running down his face while holmes rummaged him for     weapons then my friends wiry arms were round me and he was leading     me to a chair     youre not hurt watson for gods sake say that you are not hurt     it was worth a woundit was worth many woundsto know the depth of     loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask the clear hard     eyes were dimmed for a moment and the firm lips were shaking for     the one and only time i caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as     of a great brain all my years of humble but singleminded service     culminated in that moment of revelation     its nothing holmes its a mere scratch     he had ripped up my trousers with his pocketknife     you are right he cried with an immense sigh of relief it is     quite superficial his face set like flint as he glared at our     prisoner who was sitting up with a dazed face by the lord it is     as well for you if you had killed watson you would not have got out     of this room alive now sir what have you to say for yourself     he had nothing to say for himself he only sat and scowled i leaned     on holmess arm and together we looked down into the small cellar     which had been disclosed by the secret flap it was still illuminated     by the candle which evans had taken down with him our eyes fell upon     a mass of rusted machinery great rolls of paper a litter of     bottles and neatly arranged upon a small table a number of neat     little bundles     a printing pressa counterfeiters outfit said holmes     yes sir said our prisoner staggering slowly to his feet and then     sinking into the chair the greatest counterfeiter london ever saw     thats prescotts machine and those bundles on the table are two     thousand of prescotts notes worth a hundred each and fit to pass     anywhere help yourselves gentlemen call it a deal and let me beat     it     holmes laughed     we dont do things like that mr evans there is no bolthole for     you in this country you shot this man prescott did you not     yes sir and got five years for it though it was he who pulled on     me five yearswhen i should have had a medal the size of a soup     plate no living man could tell a prescott from a bank of england     and if i hadnt put him out he would have flooded london with them i     was the only one in the world who knew where he made them can you     wonder that i wanted to get to the place and can you wonder that     when i found this crazy boob of a bughunter with the queer name     squatting right on the top of it and never quitting his room i had     to do the best i could to shift him maybe i would have been wiser if     i had put him away it would have been easy enough but im a     softhearted guy that cant begin shooting unless the other man has a     gun also but say mr holmes what have i done wrong anyhow ive     not used this plant ive not hurt this old stiff where do you get     me     only attempted murder so far as i can see said holmes but     thats not our job they take that at the next stage what we wanted     at present was just your sweet self please give the yard a call     watson it wont be entirely unexpected     so those were the facts about killer evans and his remarkable     invention of the three garridebs we heard later that our poor old     friend never got over the shock of his dissipated dreams when his     castle in the air fell down it buried him beneath the ruins he was     last heard of at a nursinghome in brixton it was a glad day at the     yard when the prescott outfit was discovered for though they knew     that it existed they had never been able after the death of the     man to find out where it was evans had indeed done great service     and caused several worthy c i d men to sleep the sounder for the     counterfeiter stands in a class by himself as a public danger they     would willingly have subscribed to that soupplate medal of which the     criminal had spoken but an unappreciative bench took a less     favourable view and the killer returned to those shades from which     he had just emerged          this text is provided to you asis without any warranty no     warranties of any kind
