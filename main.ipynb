      "     Here was a bit of professional business between two gentlemen, and\n",
      "     one of them must needs call in a detective! I saw him this morning,\n",

      "     equally vital for both of you. He knew that I had means of getting\n",

      "     He made his money in real estate, and afterwards in the wheat pit at\n",
      "     Chicago, but he spent it in buying up as much land as would make one\n",
      "     of your counties, lying along the Arkansas River, west of Fort Dodge.\n",
      "     It's grazing-land and lumber-land and arable-land and\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"He had no kith nor kin--or, if he had, I never heard of it. But he\n",
      "     took a kind of pride in the queerness of his name. That was what\n",
      "     brought us together. I was in the law at Topeka, and one day I had a\n",
      "     visit from the old man, and he was tickled to death to meet another\n",
      "     man with his own name. It was his pet fad, and he was dead set to\n",
      "     find out if there were any more Garridebs in the world. 'Find me\n",
      "     another!' said he. I told him I was a busy man and could not spend my\n",
      "     life hiking round the world in search of Garridebs. 'None the less,'\n",
      "     said he, 'that is just what you will do if things pan out as I\n",
      "     planned them.' I thought he was joking, but there was a powerful lot\n",
      "     of meaning in the words, as I was soon to discover.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"For he died within a year of saying them, and he left a will behind\n",
      "     him. It was the queerest will that has ever been filed in the State\n",
      "     of Kansas. His property was divided into three parts, and I was to\n",
      "     have one on condition that I found two Garridebs who would share the\n",
      "     remainder. It's five million dollars for each if it is a cent, but we\n",
      "     can't lay a finger on it until we all three stand in a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"It was so big a chance that I just let my legal practice slide and I\n",
      "     set forth looking for Garridebs. There is not one in the United\n",
      "     States. I went through it, sir, with a fine-toothed comb and never a\n",
      "     Garrideb could I catch. Then I tried the old country. Sure enough\n",
      "     there was the name in the London telephone directory. I went after\n",
      "     him two days ago and explained the whole matter to him. But he is a\n",
      "     lone man, like myself, with some women relations, but no men. It says\n",
      "     three adult men in the will. So you see we still have a vacancy, and\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Well, Watson,\" said Holmes with a smile, \"I said it was rather\n",

      "     sir--ah, yes, Dr. Watson--if you would have the goodness to put the\n",
      "     Japanese vase to one side. You see round me my little interests in\n",
      "     life. My doctor lectures me about never going out, but why should I\n",
      "     go out when I have so much to hold me here? I can assure you that the\n",
      "     adequate cataloguing of one of those cabinets would take me three\n",

      "\n",
      "     Holmes looked round him with curiosity.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Now and again I drive down to Sotheby's or Christie's. Otherwise I\n",
      "     very seldom leave my room. I am not too strong, and my researches are\n",
      "     very absorbing. But you can imagine, Mr. Holmes, what a terrific\n",
      "     shock--pleasant but terrific--it was for me when I heard of this\n",
      "     unparalleled good fortune. It only needs one more Garrideb to\n",
      "     complete the matter, and surely we can find one. I had a brother, but\n",
      "     he is dead, and female relatives are disqualified. But there must\n",
      "     surely be others in the world. I had heard that you handled strange\n",
      "     cases, and that was why I sent to you. Of course, this American\n",

      "     but I acted for the best.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "     it up as received. Then the buckboards. That is American also. And\n",
      "     artesian wells are commoner with them than with us. It was a typical\n",

      "     his dossier: Aged forty-four. Native of Chicago. Known to have shot\n",
      "     three men in the States. Escaped from penitentiary through political\n",
      "     influence. Came to London in 1893. Shot a man over cards in a\n",
      "     night-club in the Waterloo Road in January, 1895. Man died, but he\n",
      "     was shown to have been the aggressor in the row. Dead man was\n",
      "     identified as Rodger Prescott, famous as forger and coiner in\n",
      "     Chicago. Killer Evans released in 1901. Has been under police\n",
      "     supervision since, but so far as known has led an honest life. Very\n",
      "     dangerous man, usually carries arms and is prepared to use them. That\n",
      "     is our bird, Watson--a sporting bird, as you must admit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"But what is his game?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Well, it begins to define itself. I have been to the house-agent's.\n",
      "     Our client, as he told us, has been there five years. It was unlet\n",
      "     for a year before then. The previous tenant was a gentleman at large\n",
      "     named Waldron. Waldron's appearance was well remembered at the\n",
      "     office. He had suddenly vanished and nothing more been heard of him.\n",
      "     He was a tall, bearded man with very dark features. Now, Prescott,\n",
      "     the man whom Killer Evans had shot, was, according to Scotland Yard,\n",
      "     a tall, dark man with a beard. As a working hypothesis, I think we\n",
      "     may take it that Prescott, the American criminal, used to live in the\n",
      "     very room which our innocent friend now devotes to his museum. So at\n",
      "     last we get a link, you see.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Well, we must go now and look for that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     He took a revolver from the drawer and handed it to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I have my old favourite with me. If our Wild West friend tries to\n",
      "     live up to his nickname, we must be ready for him. I'll give you an\n",
      "     hour for a siesta, Watson, and then I think it will be time for our\n",
      "     Ryder Street adventure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     It was just four o'clock when we reached the curious apartment of\n",
      "     Nathan Garrideb. Mrs. Saunders, the caretaker, was about to leave,\n",
      "     but she had no hesitation in admitting us, for the door shut with a\n",
      "     spring lock, and Holmes promised to see that all was safe before we\n",
      "     left. Shortly afterwards the outer door closed, her bonnet passed the\n",
      "     bow window, and we knew that we were alone in the lower floor of the\n",
      "     house. Holmes made a rapid examination of the premises. There was one\n",
      "     cupboard in a dark corner which stood out a little from the wall. It\n",
      "     was behind this that we eventually crouched while Holmes in a whisper\n",
      "     outlined his intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"He wanted to get our amiable friend out of his room--that is very\n",
      "     clear, and, as the collector never went out, it took some planning to\n",
      "     do it. The whole of this Garrideb invention was apparently for no\n",
      "     other end. I must say, Watson, that there is a certain devilish\n",
      "     ingenuity about it, even if the queer name of the tenant did give him\n",
      "     an opening which he could hardly have expected. He wove his plot with\n",
      "     remarkable cunning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"But what did he want?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Well, that is what we are here to find out. It has nothing whatever\n",
      "     to do with our client, so far as I can read the situation. It is\n",
      "     something connected with the man he murdered--the man who may have\n",
      "     been his confederate in crime. There is some guilty secret in the\n",
      "     room. That is how I read it. At first I thought our friend might have\n",
      "     something in his collection more valuable than he knew--something\n",
      "     worth the attention of a big criminal. But the fact that Rodger\n",
      "     Prescott of evil memory inhabited these rooms points to some deeper\n",
      "     reason. Well, Watson, we can but possess our souls in patience and\n",
      "     see what the hour may bring.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     That hour was not long in striking. We crouched closer in the shadow\n",
      "     as we heard the outer door open and shut. Then came the sharp,\n",
      "     metallic snap of a key, and the American was in the room. He closed\n",
      "     the door softly behind him, took a sharp glance around him to see\n",
      "     that all was safe, threw off his overcoat, and walked up to the\n",
      "     central table with the brisk manner of one who knows exactly what he\n",
      "     has to do and how to do it. He pushed the table to one side, tore up\n",
      "     the square of carpet on which it rested, rolled it completely back,\n",
      "     and then, drawing a jemmy from his inside pocket, he knelt down and\n",
      "     worked vigorously upon the floor. Presently we heard the sound of\n",
      "     sliding boards, and an instant later a square had opened in the\n",
      "     planks. Killer Evans struck a match, lit a stump of candle, and\n",
      "     vanished from our view.\n",

      "     Clearly our moment had come. Holmes touched my wrist as a signal, and\n",
      "     together we stole across to the open trap-door. Gently as we moved,\n",
      "     however, the old floor must have creaked under our feet, for the head\n",
      "     of our American, peering anxiously round, emerged suddenly from the\n",
      "     open space. His face turned upon us with a glare of baffled rage,\n",
      "     which gradually softened into a rather shamefaced grin as he realized\n",
      "     that two pistols were pointed at his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Well, well!\" said he coolly as he scrambled to the surface. \"I guess\n",
      "     you have been one too many for me, Mr. Holmes. Saw through my game, I\n",
      "     suppose, and played me for a sucker from the first. Well, sir, I hand\n",

      "     In an instant he had whisked out a revolver from his breast and had\n",
      "     fired two shots. I felt a sudden hot sear as if a red-hot iron had\n",
      "     been pressed to my thigh. There was a crash as Holmes's pistol came\n",
      "     down on the man's head. I had a vision of him sprawling upon the\n",
      "     floor with blood running down his face while Holmes rummaged him for\n",
      "     weapons. Then my friend's wiry arms were round me, and he was leading\n",
      "     me to a chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You're not hurt, Watson? For God's sake, say that you are not hurt!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     It was worth a wound--it was worth many wounds--to know the depth of\n",
      "     loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard\n",
      "     eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For\n",
      "     the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as\n",
      "     of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service\n",
      "     culminated in that moment of revelation.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"It's nothing, Holmes. It's a mere scratch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     He had ripped up my trousers with his pocket-knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You are right,\" he cried with an immense sigh of relief. \"It is\n",
      "     quite superficial.\" His face set like flint as he glared at our\n",
      "     prisoner, who was sitting up with a dazed face. \"By the Lord, it is\n",
      "     as well for you. If you had killed Watson, you would not have got out\n",
      "     of this room alive. Now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     He had nothing to say for himself. He only sat and scowled. I leaned\n",
      "     on Holmes's arm, and together we looked down into the small cellar\n",
      "     which had been disclosed by the secret flap. It was still illuminated\n",
      "     by the candle which Evans had taken down with him. Our eyes fell upon\n",
      "     a mass of rusted machinery, great rolls of paper, a litter of\n",
      "     bottles, and, neatly arranged upon a small table, a number of neat\n",
      "     little bundles.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"A printing press--a counterfeiter's outfit,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Yes, sir,\" said our prisoner, staggering slowly to his feet and then\n",
      "     sinking into the chair. \"The greatest counterfeiter London ever saw.\n",
      "     That's Prescott's machine, and those bundles on the table are two\n",
      "     thousand of Prescott's notes worth a hundred each and fit to pass\n",
      "     anywhere. Help yourselves, gentlemen. Call it a deal and let me beat\n",
      "     it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     Holmes laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"We don't do things like that, Mr. Evans. There is no bolt-hole for\n",
      "     you in this country. You shot this man Prescott, did you not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Yes, sir, and got five years for it, though it was he who pulled on\n",
      "     me. Five years--when I should have had a medal the size of a soup\n",
      "     plate. No living man could tell a Prescott from a Bank of England,\n",
      "     and if I hadn't put him out he would have flooded London with them. I\n",
      "     was the only one in the world who knew where he made them. Can you\n",
      "     wonder that I wanted to get to the place? And can you wonder that\n",
      "     when I found this crazy boob of a bug-hunter with the queer name\n",
      "     squatting right on the top of it, and never quitting his room, I had\n",
      "     to do the best I could to shift him? Maybe I would have been wiser if\n",
      "     I had put him away. It would have been easy enough, but I'm a\n",
      "     soft-hearted guy that can't begin shooting unless the other man has a\n",
      "     gun also. But say, Mr. Holmes, what have I done wrong, anyhow? I've\n",
      "     not used this plant. I've not hurt this old stiff. Where do you get\n",
      "     me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Only attempted murder, so far as I can see,\" said Holmes. \"But\n",
      "     that's not our job. They take that at the next stage. What we wanted\n",
      "     at present was just your sweet self. Please give the Yard a call,\n",
      "     Watson. It won't be entirely unexpected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     So those were the facts about Killer Evans and his remarkable\n",
      "     invention of the three Garridebs. We heard later that our poor old\n",
      "     friend never got over the shock of his dissipated dreams. When his\n",
      "     castle in the air fell down, it buried him beneath the ruins. He was\n",
      "     last heard of at a nursing-home in Brixton. It was a glad day at the\n",
      "     Yard when the Prescott outfit was discovered, for, though they knew\n",
      "     that it existed, they had never been able, after the death of the\n",
      "     man, to find out where it was. Evans had indeed done great service\n",
      "     and caused several worthy C. I. D. men to sleep the sounder, for the\n",
      "     counterfeiter stands in a class by himself as a public danger. They\n",
      "     would willingly have subscribed to that soup-plate medal of which the\n",
