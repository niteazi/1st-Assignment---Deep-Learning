      "     would find me at home any time to-morrow. The house is within a short\n",

      "     of melancholy, half-grown pines, and the whole aspect of the place\n",
      "     was poor and depressing. None the less, we found the house to be well\n",

      "     man who said that he was a house agent. He said that this house would\n",
      "     exactly suit a client of his, and that if I would part with it money\n",
      "     would be no object. It seemed to me very strange as there are several\n",
      "     empty houses on the market which appear to be equally eligible, but\n",
      "     naturally I was interested in what he said. I therefore named a price\n",
      "     which was five hundred pounds more than I gave. He at once closed\n",
      "     with the offer, but added that his client desired to buy the\n",
      "     furniture as well and would I put a price upon it. Some of this\n",
      "     furniture is from my old home, and it is, as you see, very good, so\n",
      "     that I named a good round sum. To this also he at once agreed. I had\n",
      "     always wanted to travel, and the bargain was so good a one that it\n",
      "     really seemed that I should be my own mistress for the rest of my\n",

      "     it you could not legally take anything out of the house--not even\n",
      "     your own private possessions?' When the man came again in the evening\n",

      "     thrust over my mouth, but I have no notion how long I may have been\n",
      "     senseless. When I woke, one man was at the bedside and another was\n",
      "     rising with a bundle in his hand from among my son's baggage, which\n",
      "     was partially opened and littered over the floor. Before he could get\n",

      "\n",

      "     as we stood together, he read over the fragment of paper. It began in\n",
      "     the middle of a sentence and ran like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"... face bled considerably from the cuts and blows, but it was\n",
      "     nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that lovely face, the\n",
      "     face for which he had been prepared to sacrifice his very life,\n",
      "     looking out at his agony and humiliation. She smiled--yes, by Heaven!\n",
      "     she smiled, like the heartless fiend she was, as he looked up at her.\n",
      "     It was at that moment that love died and hate was born. Man must live\n",
      "     for something. If it is not for your embrace, my lady, then it shall\n",
      "     surely be for your undoing and my complete revenge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Queer grammar!\" said Holmes with a smile as he handed the paper back\n",
      "     to the inspector. \"Did you notice how the 'he' suddenly changed to\n",
      "     'my'? The writer was so carried away by his own story that he\n",
      "     imagined himself at the supreme moment to be the hero.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"It seemed mighty poor stuff,\" said the inspector as he replaced it\n",
      "     in his book. \"What! are you off, Mr. Holmes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I don't think there is anything more for me to do now that the case\n",
      "     is in such capable hands. By the way, Mrs. Maberley, did you say you\n",
      "     wished to travel?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"It has always been my dream, Mr. Holmes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Where would you like to go--Cairo, Madeira, the Riviera?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Now, Watson, we are at the last lap of our little journey,\" said\n",
      "     Holmes when we were back in the roar of central London once more. \"I\n",
      "     think we had best clear the matter up at once, and it would be well\n",
      "     that you should come with me, for it is safer to have a witness when\n",

      "\n",
      "     We had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in Grosvenor\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"By the way, Watson, I suppose you see it all clearly?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"No, I can't say that I do. I only gather that we are going to see\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Exactly! But does the name Isadora Klein convey nothing to you? She\n",
      "     was, of course, the celebrated beauty. There was never a woman to\n",
      "     touch her. She is pure Spanish, the real blood of the masterful\n",
      "     Conquistadors, and her people have been leaders in Pernambuco for\n",
      "     generations. She married the aged German sugar king, Klein, and\n",
      "     presently found herself the richest as well as the most lovely widow\n",
      "     upon earth. Then there was an interval of adventure when she pleased\n",
      "     her own tastes. She had several lovers, and Douglas Maberley, one of\n",
      "     the most striking men in London, was one of them. It was by all\n",
      "     accounts more than an adventure with him. He was not a society\n",
      "     butterfly but a strong, proud man who gave and expected all. But she\n",
      "     is the 'belle dame sans merci' of fiction. When her caprice is\n",
      "     satisfied the matter is ended, and if the other party in the matter\n",
      "     can't take her word for it she knows how to bring it home to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Then that was his own story--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Ah! you are piecing it together now. I hear that she is about to\n",
      "     marry the young Duke of Lomond, who might almost be her son. His\n",
      "     Grace's ma might overlook the age, but a big scandal would be a\n",
      "     different matter, so it is imperative-- Ah! here we are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     It was one of the finest corner-houses of the West End. A\n",
      "     machine-like footman took up our cards and returned with word that\n",
      "     the lady was not at home. \"Then we shall wait until she is,\" said\n",
      "     Holmes cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The machine broke down.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Not at home means not at home to you,\" said the footman.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Good,\" Holmes answered. \"That means that we shall not have to wait.\n",
      "     Kindly give this note to your mistress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     He scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook, folded\n",

      "     Nights drawing-room, vast and wonderful, in a half gloom, picked out\n",
      "     with an occasional pink electric light. The lady had come, I felt, to\n",

      "     wonderful in the slanting rays of the setting sun. The particular\n",
      "     house to which we were directed was a large, old-fashioned, Early\n",
      "     Georgian edifice, with a flat brick face broken only by two deep bay\n",
      "     windows on the ground floor. It was on this ground floor that our\n",

      "\n",
      "     The house had a common stair, and there were a number of names\n",
      "     painted in the hall, some indicating offices and some private\n",
      "     chambers. It was not a collection of residential flats, but rather\n",
      "     the abode of Bohemian bachelors. Our client opened the door for us\n",
      "     himself and apologized by saying that the woman in charge left at\n",
      "     four o'clock. Mr. Nathan Garrideb proved to be a very tall,\n",
      "     loose-jointed, round-backed person, gaunt and bald, some sixty-odd\n",
      "     years of age. He had a cadaverous face, with the dull dead skin of a\n",
      "     man to whom exercise was unknown. Large round spectacles and a small\n",
      "     projecting goat's beard combined with his stooping attitude to give\n",

      "\n",
      "     The room was as curious as its occupant. It looked like a small\n",
      "     museum. It was both broad and deep, with cupboards and cabinets all\n",
      "     round, crowded with specimens, geological and anatomical. Cases of\n",
      "     butterflies and moths flanked each side of the entrance. A large\n",
      "     table in the centre was littered with all sorts of debris, while the\n",
      "     tall brass tube of a powerful microscope bristled up among them. As I\n",
      "     glanced round I was surprised at the universality of the man's\n",
      "     interests. Here was a case of ancient coins. There was a cabinet of\n",
      "     flint instruments. Behind his central table was a large cupboard of\n",
      "     fossil bones. Above was a line of plaster skulls with such names as\n",
      "     \"Neanderthal,\" \"Heidelberg,\" \"Cro-Magnon\" printed beneath them. It\n",
      "     was clear that he was a student of many subjects. As he stood in\n",
      "     front of us now, he held a piece of chamois leather in his right hand\n",
      "     with which he was polishing a coin.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Syracusan--of the best period,\" he explained, holding it up. \"They\n",

      "     supreme, though some prefer the Alexandrian school. You will find a\n",

      "     sir--ah, yes, Dr. Watson--if you would have the goodness to put the\n",
      "     Japanese vase to one side. You see round me my little interests in\n",
      "     life. My doctor lectures me about never going out, but why should I\n",
      "     go out when I have so much to hold me here? I can assure you that the\n",
      "     adequate cataloguing of one of those cabinets would take me three\n",
      "     good months.\"\n",

      "     \"Now and again I drive down to Sotheby's or Christie's. Otherwise I\n",
      "     very seldom leave my room. I am not too strong, and my researches are\n",
      "     very absorbing. But you can imagine, Mr. Holmes, what a terrific\n",
      "     shock--pleasant but terrific--it was for me when I heard of this\n",
      "     unparalleled good fortune. It only needs one more Garrideb to\n",
      "     complete the matter, and surely we can find one. I had a brother, but\n",
      "     he is dead, and female relatives are disqualified. But there must\n",
      "     surely be others in the world. I had heard that you handled strange\n",
      "     cases, and that was why I sent to you. Of course, this American\n",
      "     gentleman is quite right, and I should have taken his advice first,\n",
      "     but I acted for the best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I think you acted very wisely indeed,\" said Holmes. \"But are you\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Certainly not, sir. Nothing would induce me to leave my collection.\n",

      "     moment which fill gaps in my collection, and which I am unable to\n",
      "     purchase for want of a few hundred pounds. Just think what I could do\n",
      "     with five million dollars. Why, I have the nucleus of a national\n",

      "\n",
      "     His eyes gleamed behind his great spectacles. It was very clear that\n",

      "     drew an envelope from his pocket. \"I scribbled down a few points from\n",
      "     his dossier: Aged forty-four. Native of Chicago. Known to have shot\n",
      "     three men in the States. Escaped from penitentiary through political\n",
      "     influence. Came to London in 1893. Shot a man over cards in a\n",
      "     night-club in the Waterloo Road in January, 1895. Man died, but he\n",
      "     was shown to have been the aggressor in the row. Dead man was\n",
      "     identified as Rodger Prescott, famous as forger and coiner in\n",
      "     Chicago. Killer Evans released in 1901. Has been under police\n",
      "     supervision since, but so far as known has led an honest life. Very\n",
      "     dangerous man, usually carries arms and is prepared to use them. That\n",
      "     is our bird, Watson--a sporting bird, as you must admit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"But what is his game?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Well, it begins to define itself. I have been to the house-agent's.\n",
      "     Our client, as he told us, has been there five years. It was unlet\n",
      "     for a year before then. The previous tenant was a gentleman at large\n",
      "     named Waldron. Waldron's appearance was well remembered at the\n",
      "     office. He had suddenly vanished and nothing more been heard of him.\n",
      "     He was a tall, bearded man with very dark features. Now, Prescott,\n",
      "     the man whom Killer Evans had shot, was, according to Scotland Yard,\n",
      "     a tall, dark man with a beard. As a working hypothesis, I think we\n",
      "     may take it that Prescott, the American criminal, used to live in the\n",
      "     very room which our innocent friend now devotes to his museum. So at\n",
      "     last we get a link, you see.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Well, we must go now and look for that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     He took a revolver from the drawer and handed it to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I have my old favourite with me. If our Wild West friend tries to\n",
      "     live up to his nickname, we must be ready for him. I'll give you an\n",
      "     hour for a siesta, Watson, and then I think it will be time for our\n",
      "     Ryder Street adventure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     It was just four o'clock when we reached the curious apartment of\n",
      "     Nathan Garrideb. Mrs. Saunders, the caretaker, was about to leave,\n",
      "     but she had no hesitation in admitting us, for the door shut with a\n",
      "     spring lock, and Holmes promised to see that all was safe before we\n",
      "     left. Shortly afterwards the outer door closed, her bonnet passed the\n",
      "     bow window, and we knew that we were alone in the lower floor of the\n",
      "     house. Holmes made a rapid examination of the premises. There was one\n",
      "     cupboard in a dark corner which stood out a little from the wall. It\n",
      "     was behind this that we eventually crouched while Holmes in a whisper\n",
      "     outlined his intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"He wanted to get our amiable friend out of his room--that is very\n",
      "     clear, and, as the collector never went out, it took some planning to\n",
      "     do it. The whole of this Garrideb invention was apparently for no\n",
      "     other end. I must say, Watson, that there is a certain devilish\n",
      "     ingenuity about it, even if the queer name of the tenant did give him\n",
      "     an opening which he could hardly have expected. He wove his plot with\n",
      "     remarkable cunning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"But what did he want?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Well, that is what we are here to find out. It has nothing whatever\n",
      "     to do with our client, so far as I can read the situation. It is\n",
      "     something connected with the man he murdered--the man who may have\n",
      "     been his confederate in crime. There is some guilty secret in the\n",
      "     room. That is how I read it. At first I thought our friend might have\n",
      "     something in his collection more valuable than he knew--something\n",
      "     worth the attention of a big criminal. But the fact that Rodger\n",
      "     Prescott of evil memory inhabited these rooms points to some deeper\n",
      "     reason. Well, Watson, we can but possess our souls in patience and\n",
      "     see what the hour may bring.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     That hour was not long in striking. We crouched closer in the shadow\n",
      "     as we heard the outer door open and shut. Then came the sharp,\n",
      "     metallic snap of a key, and the American was in the room. He closed\n",
      "     the door softly behind him, took a sharp glance around him to see\n",
      "     that all was safe, threw off his overcoat, and walked up to the\n",
      "     central table with the brisk manner of one who knows exactly what he\n",
      "     has to do and how to do it. He pushed the table to one side, tore up\n",
      "     the square of carpet on which it rested, rolled it completely back,\n",
      "     and then, drawing a jemmy from his inside pocket, he knelt down and\n",
      "     worked vigorously upon the floor. Presently we heard the sound of\n",
      "     sliding boards, and an instant later a square had opened in the\n",
      "     planks. Killer Evans struck a match, lit a stump of candle, and\n",
      "     vanished from our view.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Clearly our moment had come. Holmes touched my wrist as a signal, and\n",
      "     together we stole across to the open trap-door. Gently as we moved,\n",
      "     however, the old floor must have creaked under our feet, for the head\n",
      "     of our American, peering anxiously round, emerged suddenly from the\n",
      "     open space. His face turned upon us with a glare of baffled rage,\n",
      "     which gradually softened into a rather shamefaced grin as he realized\n",
      "     that two pistols were pointed at his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Well, well!\" said he coolly as he scrambled to the surface. \"I guess\n",
      "     you have been one too many for me, Mr. Holmes. Saw through my game, I\n",
      "     suppose, and played me for a sucker from the first. Well, sir, I hand\n",
      "     it to you; you have me beat and--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     In an instant he had whisked out a revolver from his breast and had\n",
      "     fired two shots. I felt a sudden hot sear as if a red-hot iron had\n",
      "     been pressed to my thigh. There was a crash as Holmes's pistol came\n",
      "     down on the man's head. I had a vision of him sprawling upon the\n",
      "     floor with blood running down his face while Holmes rummaged him for\n",
      "     weapons. Then my friend's wiry arms were round me, and he was leading\n",
      "     me to a chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You're not hurt, Watson? For God's sake, say that you are not hurt!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     It was worth a wound--it was worth many wounds--to know the depth of\n",
      "     loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard\n",
      "     eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For\n",
      "     the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as\n",
      "     of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service\n",
      "     culminated in that moment of revelation.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"It's nothing, Holmes. It's a mere scratch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     He had ripped up my trousers with his pocket-knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You are right,\" he cried with an immense sigh of relief. \"It is\n",
      "     quite superficial.\" His face set like flint as he glared at our\n",
      "     prisoner, who was sitting up with a dazed face. \"By the Lord, it is\n",
      "     as well for you. If you had killed Watson, you would not have got out\n",
      "     of this room alive. Now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     He had nothing to say for himself. He only sat and scowled. I leaned\n",
      "     on Holmes's arm, and together we looked down into the small cellar\n",
      "     which had been disclosed by the secret flap. It was still illuminated\n",
      "     by the candle which Evans had taken down with him. Our eyes fell upon\n",
      "     a mass of rusted machinery, great rolls of paper, a litter of\n",
      "     bottles, and, neatly arranged upon a small table, a number of neat\n",
      "     little bundles.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"A printing press--a counterfeiter's outfit,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Yes, sir,\" said our prisoner, staggering slowly to his feet and then\n",
      "     sinking into the chair. \"The greatest counterfeiter London ever saw.\n",
      "     That's Prescott's machine, and those bundles on the table are two\n",
      "     thousand of Prescott's notes worth a hundred each and fit to pass\n",
      "     anywhere. Help yourselves, gentlemen. Call it a deal and let me beat\n",
      "     it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     Holmes laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"We don't do things like that, Mr. Evans. There is no bolt-hole for\n",
      "     you in this country. You shot this man Prescott, did you not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Yes, sir, and got five years for it, though it was he who pulled on\n",
      "     me. Five years--when I should have had a medal the size of a soup\n",
      "     plate. No living man could tell a Prescott from a Bank of England,\n",
      "     and if I hadn't put him out he would have flooded London with them. I\n",
      "     was the only one in the world who knew where he made them. Can you\n",
      "     wonder that I wanted to get to the place? And can you wonder that\n",
      "     when I found this crazy boob of a bug-hunter with the queer name\n",
      "     squatting right on the top of it, and never quitting his room, I had\n",
      "     to do the best I could to shift him? Maybe I would have been wiser if\n",
      "     I had put him away. It would have been easy enough, but I'm a\n",
      "     soft-hearted guy that can't begin shooting unless the other man has a\n",
      "     gun also. But say, Mr. Holmes, what have I done wrong, anyhow? I've\n",
      "     not used this plant. I've not hurt this old stiff. Where do you get\n",
      "     me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Only attempted murder, so far as I can see,\" said Holmes. \"But\n",
      "     that's not our job. They take that at the next stage. What we wanted\n",
